Each Contracting Party shall determine the maximum sum per TIR carnet, which may be claimed from the guaranteeing association on the basis of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above.
The liability of the guaranteeing association to the authorities of the country where the customs office of departure is situated shall commence at the time when the TIR carnet is accepted by the customs office.
In the succeeding countries through which goods are transported under the TIR procedure, this liability shall commence at the time when the goods are imported or, where the TIR operation has been suspended under Article 26 (1) and (2), at the time when the TIR carnet is accepted by the customs office where the TIR operation is resumed.
The liability of the guaranteeing association shall cover not only the goods which are enumerated in the TIR carnet but also any goods which, though not enumerated therein, may be contained in the sealed section of the road vehicle or in the sealed container.
It shall not extend to any other goods.
For the purpose of determining the duties and taxes mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the particulars of the goods as entered in the TIR carnet shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be assumed to be correct.
When payment of sums mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article becomes due, the competent authorities shall so far as possible require payment from the person or persons directly liable before making a claim against the guaranteeing association.
The guaranteeing association shall fix the period of validity of the TIR carnet by specifying a final date of validity after which the carnet may not be presented for acceptance at the customs office of departure.
Provided that it has been accepted by the customs office of departure on or before the final date of validity as provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, the carnet shall remain valid until the termination of the TIR operation at the customs office of destination.
The TIR carnet may be discharged unconditionally or conditionally ; where discharge is conditional this shall be on account of facts connected with the TIR operation itself.
These facts shall be clearly indicated in the TIR carnet.
When the customs authorities of a country have discharged a TIR carnet unconditionally they can no longer claim from the guaranteeing association payment of the sums mentioned in Article 8 (1) and (2) unless the certificate of discharge was obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner.
Where a TIR carnet has not been discharged or has been discharged conditionally, the competent authorities shall not have the right to claim payment of the sums mentioned in Article 8 (1) and (2) from the guaranteeing association unless, within a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the TIR carnet by those authorities, they have notified the association in writing of the non-discharge or conditional discharge.
The same provision shall apply where the certificate of discharge was obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner, save that the period shall be two years.
The claim for payment of the sums referred to in Article 8 (1) and (2) shall be made to the guaranteeing association at the earliest three months after the date on which the association was informed that the carnet had not been discharged or had been discharged conditionally or that the certificate of discharge had been obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner and at the latest not more than two years after that date.
However, in cases which, during the abovementioned period of two years, become the subject of legal proceedings, any claim for payment shall be made within one year of the date on which the decision of the court becomes enforceable.
The guaranteeing association shall have a period of three months, from the date when a claim for payment is made upon it, in which to pay the amounts claimed.
The sums paid shall be reimbursed to the association if, within the two years following the date on which the claim for payment was made, it has been established to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that no irregularity was committed in connection with the transport operation in question.
CHAPTER III TRANSPORT OF GOODS UNDER TIR CARNET
(a) Approval of vehicles and containers
In order to fall within the provisions of (a) and (b) of this Chapter, every road vehicle must as regards its construction and equipment fulfil the conditions set out in Annex 2 to this Convention and must have been approved according to the procedure laid down in Annex 3 hereto.
The certificate of approval shall conform to the specimen reproduced in Annex 4.
To fall within the provisions of (a) and (b) of this Chapter, containers must be constructed in conformity with the conditions laid down in Part I of Annex 7 and must have been approved according to the procedure laid down in Part II of that Annex.
Containers approved for the transport of goods under customs seal in accordance with the Customs Convention on containers, 1956, the agreements arising therefrom concluded under the auspices of the United Nations, the Customs Convention on containers, 1972, or any international instruments that may supersede or modify the latter Convention, shall be considered as complying with the provisions of paragraph 1 above and must be accepted for transport under the TIR procedure without further approval.
Each Contracting Party reserves the right to refuse to recognize the validity of the approval of road vehicles or containers which do not meet the conditions set forth in Articles 12 and 13 above.
Nevertheless, Contracting Parties shall avoid delaying traffic when the defects found are of minor importance and do not involve any risk of smuggling.
Before it is used again for the transport of goods under customs seal, any road vehicle or container which no longer meets the conditions which justified its approval, shall be either restored to its original state, or presented for re-approval.
(b) Procedure for transport under cover of a TIR carnet
No special customs document shall be required in respect of the temporary importation of a road vehicle, combination of vehicles or container carrying goods under cover of the TIR procedure.
No guarantee shall be required for the road vehicle or combination of vehicles or container.
The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not prevent a Contracting Party from requiring the fulfilment at the customs office of destination of formalities laid down by its national regulations to ensure that, once the TIR operation has been completed, the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container will be re-exported.
When a road vehicle or combination of vehicles is carrying out a TIR operation, one rectangular plate bearing the inscription "TIR" and conforming to the specifications given in Annex 5 to this Convention shall be affixed to the front and another to the rear of the road vehicle or combination of vehicles.
These plates shall be so placed as to be clearly visible and shall be removable.
A single TIR carnet shall be made out in respect of each road vehicle or container.
However, a single TIR carnet may be made out in respect of a combination of vehicles or for several containers loaded on to a single road vehicle or on to a combination of vehicles.
In that case the TIR manifest of the goods covered by the TIR carnet shall list separately the content of each vehicle in the combination of vehicles or of each container.
The TIR carnet shall be valid for one journey only.
It shall contain at least the number of detachable vouchers for customs acceptance and for discharge which are necessary for the transport operation in question.
A TIR operation may involve several customs offices of departure and destination, but, save as may otherwise be authorized by the Contracting Party or Parties concerned: (a) the customs offices of departure shall be situated in only one country;
(b) the customs offices of destination shall be situated in not more than two countries;
(c) the total number of customs offices of departure and destination shall not exceed four.
The goods and the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced with the TIR carnet at the customs office of departure.
The customs authorities of the country of departure shall take such measures as are necessary for satisfying themselves as to the accuracy of the goods manifest and/or for affixing the customs seals or for checking customs seals affixed under the responsibility of the said customs authorities by duly authorized persons.
For journeys in the territory of their country, the customs authorities may fix a time limit and require the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container to follow a prescribed route.
At each customs office en route and at customs offices of destination, the road vehicle, the combination of vehicles or the container shall be produced for purposes of control to the customs authorities together with the load and the TIR carnet relating thereto.
As a general rule and except when they examine the goods in accordance with Article 5 (2), the customs authorities of the customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the customs seals of other Contracting Parties, provided that they are intact.
The said customs authorities may, however, if control requirements make it necessary, add their own seals.
The customs seals thus accepted by a Contracting Party shall have in the territory of that Contracting Party the benefit of the same legal protection as is accorded to the national seals.
The customs authorities shall not, except in special cases: - require road vehicles, combinations of vehicles or containers to be escorted at the carriers' expense on the territory of their country,
- require examination en route of road vehicles, combinations of vehicles or containers and their loads.
If the customs authorities conduct an examination of the load of a road vehicle, combination of vehicles or container in the course of the journey or at a customs office en route, they shall record on the TIR carnet vouchers used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils, and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet, particulars of the new seals affixed and of the controls carried out.
If the customs seals are broken en route otherwise than in the circumstances of Articles 24 and 35, or if any goods are destroyed or damaged without breaking of such seals, the procedure laid down in Annex 1 to this Convention for the use of the TIR carnet shall, without prejudice to the possible application of the provisions of national law, be followed, and the certified report in the TIR carnet shall be completed.
When transport under cover of a TIR carnet takes place in part in the territory of a State which is not a Contracting Party to this Convention, the TIR operation shall be suspended during that part of the journey.
In that case, the customs authorities of the Contracting Party on whose territory the journey continues shall accept the TIR carnet for the resumption of the TIR operation, provided that the customs seals and/or identifying marks have remained intact.
The same shall apply where for a part of the journey the TIR carnet is not used by the holder of the carnet in the territory of a Contracting Party because of the existence of simpler customs transit procedures or when the use of a customs transit regime is not necessary.
In such cases the customs offices where the TIR operation is suspended or resumed shall be deemed to be customs offices of exit en route and customs offices of entry en route respectively.
Subject to the provisions of this Convention, and in particular Article 18, another customs office of destination may he substituted for a customs office of destination originally indicated.
On arrival of the load at the customs office of destination, and provided that the goods are then placed under another system of customs control or are cleared for home use, discharge of the TIR carnet shall take place without delay.
(c) Provisions concerning transport of heavy or bulky goods
The provisions of this section apply only to the transport of heavy or bulky goods as defined in Article 1 (k) of this Convention.
Where the provisions of this section apply, heavy or bulky goods may, if the authorities at the customs office of departure so decide, be carried by means of non-sealed vehicles or containers.
The provisions of this section shall apply only if, in the opinion of the authorities at the customs office of departure, the heavy or bulky goods carried and any accessories carried with them can be easily identified by reference to the description given, or can be provided with customs seals and/or identifying marks so as to prevent any substitution, or removal of the goods, without its being obvious.
All the provisions of this Convention, save those to which the special provisions of this section make an exception, shall apply to the transport of heavy or bulky goods under the TIR procedure.
The liability of the guaranteeing association shall cover not only the goods enumerated in the TIR carnet, but also any goods which, though not enumerated in the carnet, are on the load platform or among the goods enumerated in the TIR carnet.
The cover and all vouchers of the TIR carnet shall bear the endorsement "heavy or bulky goods" in hold letters in English or in French.
The authorities at the customs office of departure may require such packing lists, photographs, drawings, etc., as are necessary for the identification of the goods carried to be appended to the TIR carnet.
In this case they shall endorse these documents, one copy of the said documents shall be attached to the inside of the cover page of the TIR carnet, and all the manifests of the TIR carnet shall include a reference to such documents.
The authorities at the customs offices en route of each of the Contracting Parties shall accept the customs seals and/or identifying marks affixed by the competent authorities of other Contracting Parties.
They may, however, affix additional seals and/or identifying marks ; they shall record particulars of the new seals and/or identifying marks on the vouchers of the TIR carnet used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet.
If customs authorities conducting an examination of the load at a customs office en route or in the course of the journey are obliged to break seals and/or remove identifying marks, they shall record the new seals and/or identifying marks on the vouchers of the TIR carnet, used in their country, on the corresponding counterfoils and on the vouchers remaining in the TIR carnet.
CHAPTER IV IRREGULARITIES
Any breach of the provisions of this Convention shall render the offender liable, in the country where the offence was committed, to the penalties prescribed by the law of that country.
When it is not possible to establish in which territory an irregularity was committed it shall be deemed to have been committed in the territory of the Contracting Party where it is detected.
Each of the Contracting Parties shall have the right to exclude temporarily or permanently from the operation of this Convention any person guilty of a serious offence against the customs laws or regulations applicable to the international transport of goods.
This exclusion shall be notified immediately to the customs authorities of the Contracting Party on whose territory the person concerned is established or resident, and also to the guaranteeing association(s) in the country where the offence has been committed.
When TIR operations are accepted as being otherwise in order: 1.
The Contracting Parties shall disregard minor discrepancies in the observance of time limits or routes prescribed.
2. Likewise, discrepancies between the particulars on the goods manifest of the TIR carnet and the actual contents of a road vehicle, combination of vehicles or container shall not be considered as infringements of the Convention by the holder of the TIR carnet when evidence is produced to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that these discrepancies were not due to mistakes committed knowingly or through negligence at the time when the goods were loaded or dispatched or when the manifest was made out.
The customs administrations of the countries of departure and of destination shall not consider the holder of the TIR carnet responsible for the discrepancies which may be discovered in those countries, when the discrepancies in fact relate to the customs procedures which preceded or followed a TIR operation and in which the holder was not involved.
When it is established to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that goods specified on the manifest of a TIR carnet have been destroyed or have been irrecoverably lost by accident or force majeure or that they are short by reason of their nature, payment of the duties and taxes normally due shall be waived.
On receipt from a Contracting Party of a request giving the relevant reasons, the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties concerned in a TIR operation shall furnish that Contracting Party with all available information needed for implementation of the provisions of Articles 39, 40 and 41 above.

PROTOCOL concerning cooperation in combating pollution of the Mediterranean Sea by oil and other harmful substances in cases of emergency
THE CONTRACTING PARTIES TO THE PRESENT PROTOCOL,
BEING PARTIES to the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution,
RECOGNIZING that grave pollution of the sea by oil and other harmful substances in the Mediterranean Sea area involves a danger for the coastal States and the marine ecosystem,
CONSIDERING that the cooperation of all the coastal States of the Mediterranean is called for to combat this pollution,
BEARING IN MIND the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969, as well as the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Marine Pollution by Substances Other than Oil, 1973,
FURTHER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969,
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
The Contracting Parties to this Protocol (hereinafter referred to as "the Parties") shall cooperate in taking the necessary measures in cases of grave and imminent danger to the marine environment, the coast or related interests of one or more of the Parties due to the presence of massive quantities of oil or other harmful substances resulting from accidental causes or an accumulation of small discharges which are polluting or threatening to pollute the sea within the area defined in Article 1 of the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution (hereinafter referred to as "the Convention").
For the purpose of this Protocol, the term "related interests" means the interests of a coastal State directly affected or threatened and concerning, among others: (a) activities in coastal waters, in ports or estuaries, including fishing activities;
(b) the historical and tourist appeal of the area in question, including water sports and recreation;
(c) the health of the coastal population;
(d) the preservation of living resources.
The Parties shall endeavour to maintain and promote, either individually or through bilateral or multilateral cooperation, their contingency plans and means for combating pollution of the sea by oil and other harmful substances.
These means shall include, in particular, equipment, ships, aircraft and manpower prepared for operations in cases of emergency.
The Parties shall develop and apply, either individually or through bilateral or multilateral cooperation, monitoring activities covering the Mediterranean Sea area in order to have as precise information as possible on the situations referred to in Article 1 of this Protocol.
In the case of release or loss overboard of harmful substances in packages, freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons, the Parties shall cooperate as far as practicable in the salvage and recovery of such substances so as to reduce the danger of pollution of the marine environment.
Each Party undertakes to disseminate to the other Parties information concerning: (a) the competent national organization or authorities responsible for combating pollution of the sea by oil and other harmful substances;
(b) the competent national authorities responsible for receiving reports of pollution of the sea by oil and other harmful substances and for dealing with matters concerning measures of assistance between Parties;
(c) new ways in which pollution of the sea by oil and other harmful substances may be avoided, new measures of combating pollution and the development of related research programmes.
Parties which have agreed to exchange information directly between themselves shall nevertheless communicate such information to the regional centre.
The latter shall communicate this information to the other Parties and, on a basis of reciprocity, to coastal States of the Mediterranean Sea area which are not Parties to this Protocol.
The Parties undertake to coordinate the utilization of the means of communication at their disposal in order to ensure, with the necessary speed and reliability, the reception, transmission and dissemination of all reports and urgent information which relate to the occurrences and situations referred to in Article 1.
The regional centre shall have the necessary means of communication to enable it to participate in this coordinated effort and, in particular, to fulfil the functions assigned to it by paragraph 2 of Article 10.
Each Party shall issue instructions to the masters of ships flying its flag and to the pilots of aircraft registered in its territory requiring them to report by the most rapid and adequate channels in the circumstances, and in accordance with Annex I to this Protocol, either to a Party or to the regional centre: (a) all accidents causing or likely to cause pollution of the sea by oil or other harmful substances;
(b) the presence, characteristics and extent of spillages of oil or other harmful substances observed at sea which are likely to present a serious and imminent threat to the marine environment or to the coast or related interests of one or more of the Parties.
The information collected in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be communicated to the other Parties likely to be affected by the pollution: (a) by the Party which has received the information, either directly or preferably, through the regional centre ; or
(b) by the regional centre.
In case of direct communication between Parties, the regional centre shall be informed of the measures taken by these Parties.
In consequence of the application of the provisions of paragraph 2, the Parties are not bound by the obligation laid down in Article 9, paragraph 2, of the Convention.
Any Party faced with a situation of the kind defined in Article 1 of this Protocol shall: (a) make the necessary assessments of the nature and extent of the casualty or emergency or, as the case may be, of the type and approximate quantity of oil or other harmful substances and the direction and speed of drift of the spillage:
(b) take every practicable, measure to avoid or reduce the effects of pollution;
(c) immediately inform all other Parties, either directly or through the regional centre, of these assessments and of any action which it has taken or which it intends to take to combat the pollution;
(d) continue to observe the situation for as long as possible and report thereon in accordance with Article 8.
Where action is taken to combat pollution originating from a ship, all possible measures shall be taken to safeguard the persons present on board and, to the extent possible, the ship itself.
Any Party which takes such action shall inform the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization.
Any Party requiring assistance for combating pollution by oil or other harmful substances polluting or threatening to pollute its coasts may call for assistance from other Parties, either directly or through the regional centre referred to in Article 6, starting with the Parties which appear likely to be affected by the pollution.
This assistance may comprise, in particular, expert advice and the supply to, or placing at the disposal of, the Party concerned of products, equipment and nautical facilities.
Parties so requested shall use their best endeavours to render this assistance.

A. Industrial products
Subject to the provisions of Articles 13, 14 and 16, customs duties and charges having equivalent effect on imports into the Community of products originating in Egypt other than those listed in Annex II to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and other than those listed in Annex A, shall be abolished in accordance with the following timetable: >PIC FILE= "T0009754">

However, subject to the application by the Community of Article 39 (5) of the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the Treaties of 22 January 1972, as regards the specific duties or the specific part of the mixed duties in the customs tariffs of Ireland and of the United Kingdom, Article 9 shall be applied, rounded off to the fourth decimal place.
In the case of customs duties comprising a protective element and a fiscal element, Article 9 shall apply to the protective element.
The United Kingdom shall replace customs duties of a fiscal nature and the fiscal element of such duties by an internal tax, in accordance with Article 38 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the Treaties referred to in Article 10.

>PIC FILE= "T0009756">
From the following year, the ceilings indicated in paragraph 1 shall be raised annually by 5 %.
For the products falling within subheading 28.40 B II (phosphates, including polyphosphates, other than of ammonia) and Chapter 76 (aluminium) of the Common Customs Tariff, the Community reserves the right to introduce ceilings.
When a ceiling fixed for imports of a product covered by this Article is reached, the customs duties actually applied in respect of third countries may be reimposed on imports of the product in question until the end of the calendar year.

The ceilings provided for in this Article shall be abolished not later than 31 December 1979.

Paragraph 1 shall apply to fresh lemons of subheading 08.02 ex C of the Common Customs Tariff on condition that on the internal Community market the prices of lemons imported from Egypt are, after customs clearance and the deduction of import charges other than customs duties, not less than the reference price plus the incidence on that reference price of the customs duties actually applied in respect of third countries and a fixed amount of 1.20 units of account per 100 kilograms.
The import charges other than customs duties referred to in paragraph 2 shall be those to be used for the calculation of the entry prices referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables.
However, the Community shall be entitled to calculate the amount to be deducted in respect of the import charges other than customs duties referred to in paragraph 2 in such a way, according to origin, as to avoid difficulties which may arise from the incidence of those charges on entry prices.
Articles 23 to 28 of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 shall continue to apply.

The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to an annual quantity not exceeding 32 000 tonnes, provided that Egypt levies a special charge on exports of the products referred to in that paragraph and provided also that this special charge which is equal to the amount by which the levy is reduced is reflected in the import price into the Community.
The amount by which the levy is reduced shall be fixed each quarter by the Community.
It shall be equal to 25 % of the average level of levies applicable during a reference period.
This reference period and the rules for applying this Article shall be fixed in an exchange of letters between the Contracting Parties.
Consultations on the functioning of the system provided for in this Article may be held in the Cooperation Council.
The Community shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the levy on imports into the Community of bran, sharps and other residues derived from the sifting, milling or other working of cereals falling within subheading 23.02 A of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Egypt, is the import levy calculated in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2744/75 on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice, less a fixed amount equivalent to 60 % of the variable component of the levy.
The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply provided that Egypt levies on exports of the products referred to therein a special charge equal to the amount by which the levy is reduced and that this charge is reflected in the Community import price.

The reduced duties calculated in accordance with Article 17 shall be applied, rounded off to the first decimal place.
However, subject to the application by the Community of Article 39 (5) of the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the Treaties referred to in Article 10, as regards the specific duties or the specific part of the mixed duties in the Customs Tariffs of Ireland and of the United Kingdom, the reduced duties shall be applied, rounded off to the fourth decimal place.
The levy to which the new Member States shall apply the reduction provided for in Article 19 shall be the levy actually applied in respect of third countries.
In the new Member States the variable component of the levy referred to in Article 19 shall be calculated taking into account the rates actually applied in respect of third countries.
Should specific rules be introduced as a result of the implementation of its agricultural policy or modification of the existing rules, or should the provisions on the implementation of its agricultural policy be modified or developed, the Community may modify the arrangements laid down in the Agreement in respect of the products concerned.

There is hereby established by the Association a special account entitled "Special Action Account" constituted by the monies which the Member States shall contribute to the Special Action Account in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement which shall be held in trust and used by the Association, acting as administrator (the Association acting in that capacity is hereinafter referred to as the administrator) only for the purpose of, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Agreement.
The Special Action Account shall be kept separate and apart from all other accounts and assets of the Association.
Section 2
Each Member State shall make a contribution to the Special Action Account in an amount in its own currency equivalent as of the date of signature of this Agreement to the United States dollar amount specified below opposite its name. >PIC FILE= "T0019538">
Section 3
Payment of each contribution shall be made as follows: (a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest bearing notes of the Member State payable on demand in its currency and to the order of the Association, as administrator of the Special Action Account, and deposited in the depository of the Association in the country concerned.
(b) Payment shall be made in two instalments: (i) the first, consisting of at least 45 % of each contribution, shall be made within 30 days after the effective date of this Agreement, or such other date as may be agreed between the EEC and the administrator;
(ii) the second, consisting of the balance of the contribution, shall be made by 1 January 1979 or such other date as may be agreed between the EEC and the administrator taking account of the time necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budgets.
(c) Any Member State which so wishes may make its payments more rapidly than as indicated above.
Section 4
The administrator shall draw on the cash or notes on an approximately pro rata basis in accordance with the Association's normal procedures in order to meet disbursements of Special Action Credits and to maintain a reasonable working balance in the Special Action Account.
ARTICLE II Utilization of Special Action Account
All amounts credited to the Special Action Account shall, in accordance with the EEC's requirements, be used by the administrator exclusively for the purpose of making Special Action Credits to low-income member countries of the Association with immediate needs, in particular among the least developed (1) and the most seriously affected (1) of the developing countries, whose prospects for development have been seriously curtailed by external factors and which are faced with general problems connected with the transfer of resources and which may, as a result thereof, be faced with debt service difficulties.
In making such credits, the administrator shall, in accordance with the EEC's requirements, be guided by the following factors: (i) the relative poverty of the developing country concerned and its long-term growth potential;
(ii) the extent to which the country concerned depends on official development assistance for its external capital resources;
(iii) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and prospective economic problems of the country;
(iv) developments in and prospects for the country's export earnings;
(v) the capacity of the country to import goods essential to the development process;
(vi) the composition and the trend of the debt service obligations of the country and its capacity for any further borrowing upon non-concessional terms ; and
(vii) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are likely to be met by contributions from other sources.
Each Special Action Credit shall be made for the purpose of financing a clearly identifiable, quick-disbursing development programme or project (including a sector project) which, whether or not it is included in the Association's own lending programme, shall be appraised, approved and administered in accordance with the procedures and practices applicable to development credits made out of the Association's regular resources, taking account of the objective of additionality referred to in paragraph (b) of the preamble to this Agreement.
The resources of the Special Action Account shall not be used in substitution for regular resources of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("the Bank") or of the Association committed under a loan or credit for a programme or project which, at the effective date of this Agreement, shall have been approved by the executive directors of the Bank or the Association.
Except as provided in Section 4, the terms of repayment of each Special Action Credit shall be the same as those generally applicable to development credits made by the Association, that is to say, it shall be repayable over 50 years and with a 10-year grace period.
Special Action Credits shall not bear interest.
Special Action Credits shall be made in one or more currencies of the Member States and shall be repayable in those currencies.
Section 5
Consistent with the normal procedures of the Association, the administrator is authorized to require each borrower under a Special Action Credit to pay to the Association a service charge at the rate of three fourths of one per cent (3/4 of 1 %) per annum, payable in any currency acceptable to the Association, (1) As those terms are defined from time to time by or pursuant to Resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. on the principal amount of the Credit withdrawn and outstanding from time to time to compensate it for the services rendered hereunder.
Amounts paid for this charge shall be paid directly to and retained by the Association.
Section 6
Each Special Action Credit shall be evidenced by a separate credit agreement between the borrowing country and the administrator, indicating in particular the origin of the resources.
Section 7
The proceeds of each Special Action Credit may be used for expenditures in the currency of the borrowing country or for goods produced in, or services supplied from, (i) any of the Member States ; (ii) developing countries which are members of the Association and which could be recipients of a Special Action Credit, as determined by the administrator at the time of the agreement of the credit.
Section 8
The principal repayments of Special Action Credits shall be made payable to the Special Action Account and the amount of the currency of a Member State so repaid shall as soon as practicable thereafter be returned by the administrator to such Member State.
The Association shall not be liable for any shortfall in the repayment of Special Action Credits. ARTICLE III
Reports, consultation
Until all Special Action Credits shall have been committed, the administrator shall keep the EEC informed of projects and programmes being prepared for consideration by the executive directors and those which have been approved by the executive directors.
During the period of disbursement of Special Action Credits the administrator shall inform the EEC quarterly of the progress of the Special Action Credits and of the disbursements made thereunder.
The administrator shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Association, furnish to the EEC a detailed statement of the Special Action Account, together with an opinion of the Association's own external auditors of such statement.
After the Special Action Credits shall have been fully disbursed, the administrator shall as soon as practicable furnish to the EEC a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed from the Special Action Account.
The administrator shall establish and maintain appropriate records and accounts to identify the contributions to the Special Action Account, the commitments to be financed out of the Account, and the receipts and disbursements of funds in the Account and repayments to the Member States.
The EEC and the administrator shall fully cooperate with each other to achieve the purposes of these arrangements.
To that end, until the Special Action Account is fully disbursed, the EEC (acting through the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator shall, from time to time, exchange views on the status and condition of the Special Action Account, on the progress of the programmes or projects financed out of the Special Action Credits, and on all other matters relating to these arrangements.
ARTICLE IV Termination, distribution
If this Agreement shall not have become effective by 31 December 1978, or such later date as may be agreed between the EEC and the Association, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
If and when the entire principal amount of all Special Action Credits withdrawn by borrowers thereunder shall have been repaid and returned to the Member States in accordance with Section 8 of Article II of this Agreement, this Agreement and all obligations of the parties thereunder shall forthwith terminate.
ARTICLE V Final provisions
This Agreement shall be approved by each Member State and the EEC in accordance with the procedural requirements of each party.
The Government of each Member State shall notify the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities when such procedural requirements applicable to it have been completed.
The General Secretariat shall forward such notification, together with a notification that the EEC has duly approved this Agreement, to the Association.
This Agreement shall become effective and enter into force on the first day of the month following receipt by the Association of such notifications.

CONVENTION ON FUTURE MULTILATERAL COOPERATION IN THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES
THE CONTRACTING PARTIES ,
TILLÄGGSAVTAL till avtalet om urmakeriprodukter mellan å ena sidan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och dess medlemsstater och å andra sidan Schweiz(1)
åena sidan, och
SCHWEIZISKA FÖRBUNDSRÅDET
åandra sidan har träffat detta avtal med beaktande av följande:
ETT AVTAL om urmakeriprodukter mellan å ena sidan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och dess medlemsstater och å andra sidan Schweiz undertecknades i Genève den 30 juni 1967.
FÖR ATT DETTA AVTAL skall fungera tillfredsställande är det nödvändigt att införa ytterligare bestämmelser.
SCHWEIZISKA FÖRBUNDSRÅDETS förordning av den 23 december 1971 reglerar användningen av beteckningen "schweizisk" på ur.
DET FINNS ett nära samarbete mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Schweiz vad gäller urbranschen.
PARTERNA uppmärksammar samtidigt med att detta avtal träder i kraft avskaffandet av de rationaliseringsbidrag som lämnas av Ebauches SA och ASUAG och av de kvoter som avses i punkt B.3 b i ovan nämnda avtal.
HÄRMED AVTALAS FÖLJANDE.
De tullnedsättningar som anges i artiklarna 1 och 5 i avtalet av den 30 juni 1967 skall träda i kraft samtidigt som detta avtal.
För att ett ur med urverk av schweizisk tillverkning vad gäller minst 50 % av värdet av alla beståndsdelarna inbegripet sammansättning skall kunna anses vara schweiziskt i enlighet med artikel 2.2 b i Schweiziska förbundsrådets förordning av den 23 december 1971 om användning av beteckningen "schweiziskt" på ur, skall ett certifieringsförfarande etableras mellan Schweiz och gemenskapen i enlighet med följande bestämmelser:
Råurverk tillverkade i gemenskapen och förtecknade i bilagan till detta avtal och de reglerdon och andra delar till fickursverk som tillverkas i gemenskapen och som är avsedda som komplettering till råurverk tillverkade i Schweiz eller i gemenskapen, skall anses vara likvärda i kvalitet med råurverk och delar som tillverkats i Schweiz och som har jämförbara tekniska egenskaper.
Det förutsätts att fickur och fickursverk sammansatta av dessa råurverk och delar måste uppfylla kraven i den lagligen föreskrivna tekniska kontrollen i Schweiz.
Den i punkt 1 i denna artikel angivna förteckningen över råurverk tillverkade i gemenskapen skall regelbundet uppdateras på följande sätt:
a) Ansökningar om att råurverk av nya kalibrar skall införas i förteckningen skall sändas till Schweiziska urmakarkammaren (Chambre suisse de l'horlogerie) av urmakarsammanslutningar i gemenskapen eller av någon tillverkare i gemenskapen av råurverk. Ansökningarna skall åtföljas av en teknisk beskrivning av råurverkets kaliber.
Schweiziska urmakarkammaren skall genast införa den nya kalibern eller kalibrarna i förteckningen.
Om det begärda införandet avser urverk av en kaliber som redan är i bruk i Schweiz, men inte godkänts i den i lag föreskrivna kontrollen i Schweiz, får Schweiziska urmakarkammaren motsätta sig införandet.
I så fall får den sökande tillgripa förfarandet enligt punkt 3 i denna artikel.
b) Återkallande av råurverk med viss kaliber som är upptaget i förteckningen skall meddelas Schweiziska urmakarkammaren av den urmakarsammanslutning eller tillverkare i gemenskapen som tidigare ansökt om att råurverket skulle införas i förteckningen.
c) Om kraven i den i lag föreskrivna tekniska kontrollen inte uppfylls, får Schweiziska urmakarkammaren begära att urverken i fråga stryks från förteckningen och anmäla detta till den berörda parten.
Vid meningsskiljaktighet får den berörda parten inom två månader tillgripa förfarandet enligt punkt 3 i denna artikel.
d) Alla ansökningar om ändringar i förteckningen i enlighet med punkt a-c ovan skall genast anmälas till Gemensamma kommittén av Schweiziska urmakarkammaren.
Vid tvist om likvärdig kvalitet skall saken genast av berörd part hänskjutas till den gemensamma kommitté som föreskrivs i artikel 9 i avtalet av den 30 juni 1967.
Den första part som beslutar att göra detta skall på eget initiativ begära ett gemensamt sakkunnigutlåtande från institutet för officiell kvalitetskontroll för schweiziska urbranschen och ett motsvarande av den berörda parten i gemenskapen utsett kvalificerat institut i gemenskapen.
De båda instituten skall få tre månader på sig att avge det begärda sakkunnigutlåtandet.
De skall därvid enas om att granska två tillräckligt representativa satser av fickur eller fickursverk, vardera normalt innehållande högst 50 enheter, den ena från ett schweiziskt företag, den andra från ett företag i gemenskapen.
Efter att ha provat dessa satser enligt de standarder för teknisk kontroll som enligt lag gäller i Schweiz, skall de bägge instituten jämföra sina resultat och gemensamt utarbeta en rapport till Gemensamma kommittén med sina slutsatser och eventuella förslag.
Gemensamma kommittén skall behandla rapporten vid sitt nästa möte.
Avtalet och den därtill fogade förteckningen skall offentliggöras i de avtalsslutande parternas officiella tidningar och meddelas urtillverkarna via berörda branschorganisationer.
Förändringar i förteckningen skall offentliggöras och meddelas på samma sätt.
Minst vart tredje år, räknat från avtalets ikraftträdande, skall Gemensamma kommittén granska förteckningen och notera alla poster som under mellantiden införts eller strukits.
Den nya förteckningen skall offentliggöras och meddelas på samma sätt.
All ytterligare information kan fås från de berörda branschorganisationerna.
Endera avtalsslutande parten får säga upp avtalet med tolv månaders uppsägningstid.
Avtalet skall slutas och ratificeras av de avtalsslutande parterna i enlighet med deras egna förfaranden.
Avtalet skall träda i kraft den 1 januari 1973 under förutsättning att de avtalsslutande parterna då har utväxlat ratificeringshandlingar.
Om ratificeringshandlingar utväxlas mellan den 1 januari 1973 och den 30 november 1973, skall avtalet träda i kraft den första dagen i den andra månaden efter utväxlingen. (1) Detta avtal har endast upprättats på franska. 11 2 1994 6 1
AVTAL mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Schweiz
EUROPEISKA EKONOMISKA GEMENSKAPEN
som den ena parten, och
SCHWEIZ
som den andra parten,
ÖNSKAR att konsolidera och med tanke på utvidgningen av Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen utöka de existerande ekonomiska relationerna mellan gemenskapen och Schweiz och att med vederbörlig hänsyn till korrekta konkurrensvillkor säkerställa den harmoniska utvecklingen av sin handel med avsikt att bidra till det europeiska uppbyggnadsarbetet,
BESLUTAR för detta ändamål stegvis undanröja hindren för väsentligen all sin handel i överensstämmelse med bestämmelserna om upprättandet av frihandelsområden i det allmänna tull- och handelsavtalet,
DEKLARERAR sin beredvillighet att i ljuset av varje tillämplig faktor och särskilt utvecklingen inom gemenskapen undersöka möjligheten av att utveckla och fördjupa sina relationer där det med hänsyn till de ekonomiska intressena skulle visa sig nyttigt att utvidga dem till områden som inte omfattas av detta avtal,
HAR BESLUTAT att i sin strävan att uppnå dessa mål och med beaktande av att ingen bestämmelse i detta avtal får tolkas som ett fritagande av avtalsparterna från de skyldigheter som åligger dem enligt andra internationella avtal,
HÄRIGENOM TRÄFFAS DETTA AVTAL.
Målet med detta avtal är
a) att genom utvidgning av den ömsesidiga handeln främja den harmoniska utvecklingen av de ekonomiska relationerna mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Schweiz och sålunda inom gemenskapen och i Schweiz befordra ekonomiska framsteg inom ekonomisk aktivitet, förbättra levnadsförhållanden och anställningsförhållanden samt öka produktivitet och finansiell stabilitet,
b) att tillhandahålla korrekta konkurrensvillkor för handeln mellan avtalsparterna,
c) att på detta sätt genom avlägsnandet av handelshinder bidra till världshandelns harmoniska utveckling och expansion.
Avtalet skall gälla för varor med ursprung inom gemenskapen eller i Schweiz
i) som omfattas av kapitel 25-99 i Brysselnomenklaturen med undantag av varor enligt bilaga 1,
ii) som närmare anges i protokoll nr 2 med vederbörlig hänsyn till de förfaranden som bestäms i detta protokoll.
Inga nya importtullar skall införas på varor mellan gemenskapen och Schweiz.
Importtullarna skall gradvis avskaffas enligt följande tidtabell:
a) Den 1 april 1973 skall varje importtull minskas till 80 % av utgångsvärdet.
b) Fyra ytterligare minskningar med 20 % vardera skall vidtas
den 1 januari 1974,
Bestämmelserna avseende den gradvisa avvecklingen av importtullarna skall också avse tullavgifter av fiskal natur.
Avtalsparterna får ersätta en tullavgift av fiskal natur eller ett fiskalt element i en tullavgift med en intern skatt.
Danmark, Irland, Norge och Storbritannien får fram till 1 januari 1976 bibehålla en avgift av fiskal natur eller ett fiskalt element i en importtull vid tillämpning av artikel 38 i "Akten om anslutningsvillkoren och anpassningarna av fördragen" som utarbetats av och antagits inom konferensen mellan Europeiska gemenskaperna och Danmark, Irland, Norge och Storbritannien.
Schweiz får, med beaktande av villkoren i artikel 18, temporärt behålla avgifter som motsvarar ett fiskalt element i importtullarna på varor som närmare anges i bilaga 2.
Den gemensamma kommittén enligt artikel 29 skall undersöka om de villkor som anges i föregående stycke uppfylls, särskilt om en ändring av storleken på den fiskala delen har vidtagits.
Den gemensamma kommittén skall undersöka läget med hänsyn till omvandlingen av dessa tullar till interna avgifter före den 1 januari 1980 eller före något annat datum som kommittén kan bestämma med hänsyn till omständigheterna.
Det utgångsvärde på importtullen på vilket de gradvisa minskningarna enligt artikel 3 och protokoll nr 1 skall tillämpas skall vara den importtull som verkligen tillämpades den 1 januari 1972.
Om efter den den 1 januari 1972 några tullminskningar skulle tillämpas till följd av avtal som träffats vid handelskonferensen i Genève 1964-1967 skall de på detta sätt minskade tullsatserna ersätta de utgångstullar som anges i punkt 1.
De minskade tullarna enligt artikel 3 och protokoll nr 1 skall tillämpas med avrundning till den första decimalen.
Med beaktande av gemenskapens tillämpning av artikel 39.5 i "Akten om anslutningsvillkoren och anpassningarna av fördragen" som utarbetats av och antagits inom konferensen mellan Europeiska gemenskaperna och Danmark, Irland, Norge och Storbritannien, vad gäller särskilda tullar eller den särskilda delen av blandade tullar i den irländska tulltaxan, skall denna artikel 3 och protokoll nr 1 tillämpas med avrundning till den fjärde decimalen.
Inga nya avgifter, som har samma verkan som importtullar, skall införas i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Schweiz.
Avgifter med samma verkan som importtullar som införs den 1 januari 1972 eller efter denna dag i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Schweiz skall avskaffas då avtalet träder i kraft.
Alla avgifter med samma verkan som importtullar vars storlek den 31 december 1972 är högre än de som verkligen tillämpades den 1 januari 1972, skall minskas till den senare tullsatsen då avtalet träder i kraft.
Avgifter med samma verkan som importtullar skall gradvis avskaffas enligt följande tidtabell:
a) Senast den 1 januari 1974 skall varje avgift minskas till 60 % av den tullsats som tillämpas den 1 januari 1972.
b) Tre ytterligare minskningar om 20 % vardera skall göras
den 1 januari 1975,
den 1 januari 1976,
den 1 juli 1977.
Ingen exporttull eller avgift med samma verkan skall införas i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Schweiz.
Exporttullar och avgifter som har samma verkan skall avskaffas senast den 1 januari 1974.
I fråga om varor enligt bilaga 3 får avtalsparterna på det sätt som de skall besluta, vidta de åtgärder som de anser nödvändiga för att genomföra sin försörjningspolitik.
Protokoll nr 1 bestämmer tullbehandlingen och förfaranden som gäller vissa varor.
Protokoll nr 2 bestämmer tullbehandlingen och de förfaranden som gäller vissa varor som erhålls genom bearbetning av jordbruksvaror.
I händelse av att särskilda regler fastställs till följd av någon ändring av de nuvarande reglerna får avtalsparten i fråga anta de förfaranden som är resultatet av detta avtal med avseende på de varor som är föremål för dessa regler eller ändringar.
I dessa fall skall avtalsparten i fråga ta vederbörlig hänsyn till den andra partens intressen.
Av denna anledning får avtalsparterna rådgöra med varandra inom den gemensamma kommittén.
Protokoll nr 3 bestämmer ursprungsreglerna.
En avtalspart, som avser att minska den effektiva nivån på sina tullar och avgifter, med en verkan som är likvärdig med den som tredje land får, då detta land drar fördel av att behandlas som mest gynnad nation, eller som avser att dra tillbaka sin ansökan, skall i den utsträckning det är praktiskt möjligt underrätta den gemensamma kommittén minst trettio dagar innan denna minskning eller detta tillbakadragande träder i kraft.
Avtalsparten skall beakta alla uppgifter från den andra parten om alla störningar som detta kan orsaka.
Inga nya kvantitativa importrestriktioner eller åtgärder med motsvarande verkan skall införas i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Schweiz.
Kvantitativa importbegränsningar skall avskaffas den 1 januari 1973 och alla åtgärder som har en inverkan likvärdig med kvantitativa begränsningar på importen skall avskaffas senast den 1 januari 1975.
Gemenskapen förbehåller sig rätten att ändra de förfaranden som avser petroleumprodukter enligt nummer 27.10, 27.11, 27.12, ur 27.13 (paraffin, mikrovax eller bituminösa skiffrar och andra mineralvaxer) och 27.14 i Brysselnomenklaturen efter antagandet av en gemensam ursprungsdefinition för petroleumprodukter, när beslut fattas enligt den gemensamma handelspolitiken för varorna i fråga eller en gemensam energipolitik fastställs.
I detta fall skall gemenskapen ta vederbörlig hänsyn till Schweiz intressen. Av denna anledning skall gemenskapen underrätta den gemensamma kommittén som skall träffas på de villkor som anges i artikel 31.
Schweiz förbehåller sig rätten att vidta liknande åtgärder om det skulle ställas inför motsvarande situationer.
Med beaktande av punkterna 1 och 2 skall avtalet inte föregripa andra bestämmelser än tullregler som gäller vid import av petroleumprodukter.
Avtalsparterna förklarar sig beredda att, i den utsträckning deras jordbrukspolitik så medger, främja den harmoniska utvecklingen av handeln med jordbruksvaror som inte omfattas av detta avtal.
Avtalsparterna skall tillämpa sina regler inom veterinärmedicin, hälsa och växthygien på ett icke-diskriminerande sätt och skall inte införa några nya bestämmelser som kan otillbörligt hindra handeln.
Avtalsparterna skall på de villkor som anges i artikel 31 undersöka alla svårigheter som kan uppstå i handeln med jordbruksvaror och skall sträva efter att finna lämpliga lösningar.
Från och med den 1 juli 1977 får varor som framställs i Schweiz inte åtnjuta mer fördelaktig behandling när de importeras till gemenskapen än den behandling som tillämpas mellan gemenskapens medlemsstater.
Avtalet skall inte utesluta underhåll av eller upprättande av tullunioner, frihandelsområden eller förfaranden för gränshandel, utom i den utsträckning de ändrar förfarandena i detta avtal, särskilt bestämmelserna om ursprungsregler.
Avtalsparterna skall avstå från varje åtgärd eller praxis av intern fiskal natur som åstadkommer vare sig direkt eller indirekt diskriminering av en avtalsparts varor i förhållande till liknande varor som framställs inom den andra avtalspartens territorium.
Varor som exporteras till ett av avtalsparternas territorier får inte åtnjuta återbetalning av intern beskattning utöver den direkta eller indirekta beskattning som påläggs dessa varor.
Betalning som avser handel med varor och överföring av denna betalning till den medlemsstat inom gemenskapen i vilken fordringsägaren är bosatt eller till Schweiz skall vara fri från alla begränsningar.
Avtalsparterna skall avstå från alla valutarestriktioner eller administrativa begränsningar som avser beviljande, återbetalning eller godkännande av kortfristiga och medellånga krediter som omfattar kommersiella transaktioner i vilka en invånare deltar.
Avtalet skall inte utesluta förbud eller begränsningar av import, export eller varor i transit som motiveras av allmän moral, lag och ordning eller allmän säkerhet, skydd av liv och hälsa för människor och djur, skydd av växter, skydd av nationella skatter av konstnärligt, historiskt eller arkeologiskt värde, skydd av industriell och kommersiell egendom eller regler som avser guld eller silver.
Dessa förbud eller begränsningar får dock inte medföra godtycklig diskriminering eller kamouflerad begränsning av handeln mellan avtalsparterna.
Ingenting i avtalet skall hindra avtalsparterna från att vidta några åtgärder
a) som avtalsparten anser nödvändiga för att förhindra avslöjandet av upplysningar som strider mot avtalspartens väsentliga säkerhetsintressen,
b) som avser handeln med vapen, ammunition eller krigsmateriel eller avser forskning, utveckling eller tillverkning som är oundgänglig för försvarsändamål under förutsättning att dessa åtgärder inte skadar konkurrensvillkoren med avseende på varor som inte är avsedda för militära ändamål,
c) som avtalsparten anser är väsentliga för sin egen säkerhet under krig eller allvarlig internationell spänning.
Avtalsparterna skall avstå från alla åtgärder som kan äventyra uppfyllandet av avtalets mål.
Avtalsparterna skall vidta alla allmänna eller särskilda åtgärder som krävs för att uppfylla sina skyldigheter enligt avtalet.
Om den ena av avtalsparterna anser att den andra har brustit i uppfyllandet av någon skyldighet enligt avtalet får den vidta lämpliga åtgärder på de villkor och enligt de förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 27.
Följande är oförenligt med avtalets korrekta funktion i den utsträckning som det påverkar handeln mellan gemenskapen och Schweiz:
i) Alla avtal mellan företag, beslut av företagsgrupper och samordnade åtgärder mellan företag för att förhindra eller störa konkurrensen i fråga om tillverkning av eller handel med varor.
ii) Missbruk av ett eller flera företag med en dominerande ställning i avtalsparternas hela territorium eller väsentlig del av detta.
iii) Varje offentligt stöd som stör eller hotar att störa konkurrensen genom att gynna vissa företag eller framställningen av vissa varor.
Om en avtalspart skulle anse att en viss åtgärd är oförenlig med denna artikel får avtalsparten vidta lämpliga åtgärder på de villkor och enligt de förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 27.
Om en ökning av importen av en viss vara sannolikt allvarligt skadar någon tillverkning som utförs i en av avtalsparternas territorier och om denna ökning beror på orsaker enligt i) eller ii) nedan, får den berörda avtalsparten vidta lämpliga åtgärder på de villkor och enligt de förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 27.
i) Delvis eller total minskning av importtullar eller avgifter med likvärdig verkan på varan i fråga hos den importerande avtalsparten enligt bestämmelserna i avtalet,
ii) Det faktum att tullar och avgifter med likvärdig inverkan som tas ut av den exporterande avtalsparten på import av råvaror eller halvfabrikat som används vid tillverkning av varan i fråga är påtagligt lägre än motsvarande tullar och avgifter som tas ut av den importerande avtalsparten.
Om en av avtalsparterna konstaterar att dumpning äger rum vid handel med den andra avtalsparten får denna part vidta lämpliga åtgärder mot detta enligt avtalet om genomförande av artikel VI i det allmänna tull- och handelsavtalet på de villkor och enligt de förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 27.
Om allvarliga störningar uppstår inom någon del av ekonomin eller om svårigheter uppstår som skulle kunna orsaka allvarliga störningar i den ekonomiska situationen i en region får den berörda avtalsparten vidta lämpliga åtgärder på de villkor och enligt de förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 27.
Om en avtalspart utsätter import av varor, som kan vålla svårigheter enligt artiklarna 24 och 26 för ett administrativt förfarande, vars ändamål är att tillhandahålla snabba upplysningar om handelsrörelser skall denna avtalspart underrätta den andra avtalsparten.
I de fall som anges i artikel 22-26 skall avtalsparten i fråga, innan parten vidtar de åtgärder som anges i dessa eller, i fall då punkt 3 d gäller så snart som möjligt förse den gemensamma kommittén med alla tillämpliga upplysningar som behövs för en noggrann undersökning av situationen för att söka en lösning som kan godkännas av kontraktsparterna.
Vid valet av åtgärder skall de åtgärder ges företräde som minst stör avtalet.
Säkerhetsåtgärderna skall omedelbart delges den gemensamma kommittén och skall vara underkastade regelbundna samråd inom kommittén, särskilt med avsikten att avskaffa dem så snart omständigheterna så medger.
För genomförandet av punkt 2 skall följande bestämmelser gälla:
a) I fråga om artikel 23 får endera avtalsparten hänföra frågan till den gemensamma kommittén om den anser att en viss praxis gör att avtalet inte kan fungera på rätt sätt enligt artikel 23.1.
Avtalsparterna skall förse den gemensamma kommittén med alla tillämpliga upplysningar och skall ge kommittén det bistånd den behöver för att undersöka ärendet och om så är tillämpligt undanröja den kritiserade praxisen.
Om avtalsparten i fråga inte slutar med den kritiserade praxisen inom den tid som fastställs av den gemensamma kommittén eller vid avsaknad av ett avtal i den gemensamma kommittén inom tre månader efter det att ärendet hänförts dit, får den berörda avtalsparten vidta varje säkerhetsåtgärd parten anser nödvändig för att hantera de allvarliga svårigheter som är ett resultat av praxisen i fråga. Särskilt får avtalsparten dra in tullnedsättningar.
b) I fråga om artikel 24 skall de svårigheter som orsakas av den situation som anges i denna artikel hänföras för undersökning till den gemensamma kommittén som får fatta varje beslut som behövs för att sätta stopp för dessa svårigheter.
Om den gemensamma kommittén eller den exporterande avtalsparten inte har fattat något beslut som sätter stopp för svårigheterna inom trettio dagar efter det att ärendet anmälts, är den importerande avtalsparten berättigad att ta ut en kompensationsavgift på den importerade varan.
Kompensationsavgiften skall beräknas med avseende på den inverkan som skillnaderna i tull på de råvaror eller halvfabrikat, som ingår i varorna, har på värdet av varorna i fråga.
c) I fråga om artikel 25 skall överläggningar äga rum i den gemensamma kommittén innan den berörda avtalsparten vidtar de tillämpliga åtgärderna.
d) Om utomordentliga omständigheter som kräver omedelbar åtgärd omöjliggör undersökning i förväg får den berörda avtalsparten i de situationer som anges i artiklarna 24-26 och även i fråga om exportstöd som har direkt och omedelbar inverkan på handeln omedelbart tillämpa de försiktighetsåtgärder som är oundgängligen nödvändiga för att avhjälpa situationen.

Parten skall skyndsamt underrätta den andra avtalsparten.
En gemensam kommitté skall upprättas som är ansvarig för administrationen av avtalet och skall garantera dess riktiga tillämpning.
För detta ändamål skall den utfärda rekommendationer och fatta beslut i de fall som bestäms i avtalet.
Dessa beslut skall ikraftsättas av avtalsparterna enligt deras egna bestämmelser.
För den riktiga tillämpningen av avtalet skall avtalsparterna utbyta upplysningar och på begäran av endera parten överlägga inom den gemensamma kommittén.
Den gemensamma kommittén skall själv fastställa sin arbetsordning.
Den gemensamma kommittén skall bestå av å ena sidan representanter för gemenskapen och å den andra sidan representanter för Schweiz.

Ordföranden skall sammankalla möten minst en gång om året för att granska att avtalet fungerar.
Den gemensamma kommittén skall dessutom sammanträda så snart särskilda omständigheter så påfordrar på begäran av endera avtalsparten enligt de villkor som anges i arbetsordningen.
Den gemensamma kommittén får besluta om inrättande av alla arbetsgrupper som kan hjälpa till med kommitténs uppgifter.
Om en avtalspart anser att det skulle vara värdefullt för båda avtalsparternas ekonomiska intressen att utveckla de relationer som fastställs i avtalet genom att utvidga dem till områden som nu inte ingår, skall de sända en motiverad begäran till den andra avtalsparten.
Avtalsparterna får ge den gemensamma kommittén i uppdrag att undersöka denna begäran och om så är tillämpligt utfärda rekommendationer till avtalsparterna, särskilt med avsikt att öppna förhandlingar.
De avtal som blir resultatet av förhandlingarna enligt punkt 1 kommer att bli föremål för avtalsparternas ratificering eller godkännande enligt deras egna förfaranden.
Bilagorna och protokollen till avtalet skall utgöra en integrerad del av detta avtal.
Endera avtalsparten får säga upp avtalet genom att underrätta den andra avtalsparten.
Avtalet skall upphöra att vara i kraft tolv månader efter dagen för denna anmälan.
Avtalet skall gälla å ena sidan för de territorier för vilka fördraget om upprättandet av Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen gäller och å den andra för Schweiz territorium.

TILLÄGGSAVTAL Om giltigheten för Liechtenstein av avtalet av den 22 juli 1972 mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Schweiz
EUROPEISKA EKONOMISKA GEMENSKAPEN,
SCHWEIZ,
LIECHTENSTEIN, HAR TRÄFFAT FÖLJANDE AVTAL:
Genom Fördraget av den 29 mars 1923 har Liechtenstein och Schweiz konstituerat en gemensam union och det fördraget ger inte giltighet i Liechtenstein åt alla bestämmelserna i avtalet mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Schweiz av den 22 juli 1972.
Liechtenstein har uttryckt en önskan om att alla bestämmelser i detta avtal skall ha giltighet för Liechtenstein.
HÄRIGENOM AVTALAS FÖLJANDE:
Avtalet mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Schweiz av den 22 juli 1972 skall på samma sätt tillämpas för Liechtenstein.
För att tillämpa avtalet enligt artikel 1 och utan att modifiera dess bilaterala natur mellan gemenskapen och Schweiz får Liechtenstein bevaka sina intressen genom att representeras av en representant i den schweiziska delegationen i den gemensamma kommittén.
Detta tilläggsavtal kommer att godkännas av Schweiz, Liechtenstein och gemenskapen enligt deras egna förfaranden.
Tilläggsavtalet skall träda i kraft samma dag som avtalet enligt artikel 1 och skall fortsätta att gälla så länge som Fördraget av den 29 mars 1923 är i kraft. Utfärdat i Bryssel den tjugoandra juli nittonhundrasjuttiotvå.
AVTAL mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Island EUROPEISKA EKONOMISKA GEMENSKAPEN å ena sidan, och
ISLAND å andra sidan,
SOM ÖNSKAR, när Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen vidgas, befästa och utöka de ekonomiska band som finns mellan gemenskapen och Island och, med beaktande av rättvisa konkurrensvillkor, säkerställa en harmonisk utveckling av sin handel för att bidra till uppbyggnadsarbetet av Europa,
SOM ÄR BESLUTNA att i detta syfte gradvis avlägsna hindren för väsentligen all sin handel enligt det allmänna tull- och handelsavtalets bestämmelser om upprättandet av frihandelsområden,
SOM FÖRKLARAR att de är beredda att, mot bakgrund av alla relevanta faktorer och framförallt utvecklingen i gemenskapen, undersöka möjligheten att utveckla och fördjupa sina förbindelser och, om detta skulle vara av intresse för bådas ekonomi, att utsträcka dessa till områden som inte omfattas av detta avtal,
HAR BESLUTAT, i strävan efter dessa mål och med beaktande av att inga bestämmelser i detta avtal får tolkas så att de avtalsslutande parterna är befriade från de förpliktelser som åligger dem enligt andra internationella avtal,
ATT SLUTA DETTA AVTAL.
Syftet med detta avtal är a) att genom utvidgning av sin ömsesidiga handel främja en harmonisk utveckling av de ekonomiska förbindelserna mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Island och på så sätt stödja framåtskridandet i ekonomisk verksamhet, förbättringen av levnadsvillkor och anställningsvillkor samt ökad produktivitet och finansiell stabilitet, b) att skapa rättvisa konkurrensvillkor i handeln mellan de avtalsslutande parterna,
c) att på detta sätt avlägsna handelsmurar och bidra till en harmonisk utveckling och utvidgning av världshandeln.
Avtalet skall tillämpas på varor med ursprung i gemenskapen eller Island, i) som omfattas av kapitlen 25-99 i Brysselnomenklaturen med undantag av de varor som är förtecknade i bilaga 1, ii) som är närmare angivna i protokoll nr 2 och nr 6 med beaktande av de arrangemang som föreskrivs i dessa protokoll.
1. Inga nya importtullar skall införas i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Island.
2. Gemenskapen i dess ursprungliga sammansättning och Island skall gradvis avskaffa sina importtullar enligt följande tidtabell:
a) Den 1 april 1973 skall varje tull sänkas till 80 % av bastullen.
b) Fyra ytterligare sänkningar med 20 % vardera skall ske
den 1 januari 1974,
den 1 januari 1975,
den 1 januari 1976, och
den 1 juli 1977.
Den bastull, som skall tillämpas för de på varandra följande sänkningar som föreskrivs i denna artikel, skall vara den faktiskt tillämpade tullen den 1 januari 1972.
Vid eventuella taxesänkningar efter den 1 januari 1972 enligt de taxeavtal, som slutits till följd av handelskonferensen i Genève mellan 1964 och 1967, skall de sänkta tullarna ersätta de bastullar som avses i föregående stycke.
De sänkta tullarna, beräknade enligt denna artikel och protokoll nr 1, skall tillämpas med avrundning till en decimal.
Utan att det påverkar gemenskapens tillämpning av artikel 39.5 i "Rättsakten om villkoren för anslutning och anpassningarna till fördragen", som upprättats och antagits vid konferensen mellan Europeiska gemenskaperna och Danmark, Irland, Norge och Storbritannien beträffande de särskilda tullarna eller den särskilda delen av de blandade tullarna i den irländska tulltaxan, skall denna artikel och protokoll nr 1 tillämpas med avrundning till fyra decimaler.
De angivna dagarna skall Island sänka sina tullar på importer från gemenskapen i dess ursprungliga sammansättning och Irland till de olika bastullsatserna som tillämpades den 1 mars 1970 enligt vad som närmare anges nedan. >Plats för tabell>
Efter den 1 januari 1974 skall Island fortsätta att sänka sina tullar avseende Danmark, Norge och Storbritannien enligt den tidtabell som anges i punkt 1.
Bestämmelserna om det gradvisa avskaffandet av importtullar skall även tillämpas för fiskala tullar.
De avtalsslutande parterna får ersätta en fiskal tull eller en fiskal del av en tull med en inhemsk skatt.
Island får med beaktande av villkoren i artikel 19 temporärt behålla sina fiskala tullar för de varor som anges i bilaga 2.
När Island startar en tillverkning av en vara liknande en av dem som anges i bilaga 2, skall den tillämpliga tullen för den senare varan sänkas till den nivå, som skulle ha nåtts, om denna tull hade sänkts enligt tidtabellen i artikel 4.1 efter det att avtalet trätt i kraft.
Om en tull som är lägre än en fiskal avgift införs för tredje land, skall sänkningarna av tulltaxan grundas på den föregående tullen.
Efterföljande sänkningar skall ske enligt den i artikel 4.1 fastställda tidtabellen.
Danmark, Irland, Norge och Storbritannien får behålla en fiskal avgift eller den fiskala delen av en tull till den 1 januari 1976 vid genomförandet av artikel 38 i "Rättsakten om villkoren för anslutning och anpassningarna till fördragen", som upprättats och antagits vid konferensen mellan Europeiska gemenskaperna och Danmark, Irland, Norge och Storbritannien.
Ingen ny avgift med en verkan motsvarande en importtull skall införas i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Island.
Avgifter med en verkan motsvarande importtullar, som införts efter den 1 januari 1972 i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Island, skall avskaffas när avtalet träder i kraft.
Alla avgifter som har en verkan motsvarande en importtull som har en tullsats som den 31 december 1972 är högre än den som faktiskt tillämpades den 1 januari 1972 skall sänkas till den senare tullsatsen, när avtalet träder i kraft.
Avgifter med en verkan motsvarande importtullar skall gradvis avskaffas enligt följande tidtabell: a) Senast den 1 januari 1974 skall varje avgift sänkas till 60 % av den tullsats som tillämpades den 1 januari 1972.
b) Tre ytterligare sänkningar med vardera 20 % skall ske
den 1 januari 1977.
Inga exporttullar eller avgifter med motsvarande verkan skall införas i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Island.
Exporttullar och avgifter med motsvarande verkan skall avskaffas senast den 1 januari 1974.
Island får behålla systemet med exportskatt för fiskvaror som tillämpas den 1 januari 1972, vilket anges i bilaga 3.
Inga ändringar som görs i systemet får förändra dess karaktär eller syften.
Den gemensamma kommittén skall på förhand underrättas om alla förändringar.
Protokoll nr 1 fastställer den tulltaxa och de arrangemang som skall tillämpas på vissa varor.
Protokoll nr 2 fastställer den tulltaxa och de arrangemang som skall tillämpas på vissa produkter som framställts genom bearbetning av jordbruksprodukter.
I händelse av att särskilda bestämmelser fastställs till följd av genomförandet av avtalsparternas jordbrukspolitik eller av eventuella ändringar i gällande bestämmelser, får den berörda avtalsparten anpassa de arrangemang som tillkommit till följd av detta avtal för de varor som omfattas av dessa bestämmelser eller ändringar.
I dessa fall skall den berörda avtalsparten ta vederbörlig hänsyn till den andra avtalspartens intressen.
För detta syfte får de avtalsslutande parterna samråda inom den gemensamma kommitté som anges i artikel 30.
Protokoll nr 3 fastställer reglerna om ursprung.
En avtalsslutande part som överväger att sänka den effektiva nivån på sina tullar eller avgifter med motsvarande verkan som tillämpas för tredje land, som gynnas av behandlingen som mest gynnad nation eller som avser att tillfälligt upphäva tillämpningen av dem, skall i den mån det är genomförbart anmäla detta till den gemensamma kommittén senast trettio dagar innan denna sänkning eller detta upphävande träder i kraft.
Den skall uppmärksamma alla framställningar från den andra avtalsslutande parten om eventuella snedvridningar som kan uppstå som en följd av detta.
Inga nya kvantitativa restriktioner för importer eller åtgärder med motsvarande verkan skall införas i handeln mellan gemenskapen och Island.
Gemenskapen skall avskaffa sina kvantitativa restriktioner för importer den 1 januari 1973 och alla åtgärder med en verkan motsvarande kvantitativa restriktioner för importer senast den 1 januari 1975.
Island skall avskaffa sina kvantitativa restriktioner för importer och alla åtgärder med en verkan motsvarande kvantitativa restriktioner för importer senast den 1 januari 1975.
Gemenskapen förbehåller sig rätten att anpassa de avtal som gäller för petroleumprodukter enligt nummer 27.10-27.12, ur 27.13 (paraffinvax, mikrovax eller bituminös skiffer och andra mineralvaxer) och 27.14 i Brysselnomenklaturen vid antagandet av en gemensam definition för petroleumprodukters ursprung, vid antagandet av beslut enligt den gemensamma handelspolitiken för produkterna i fråga eller vid antagandet av en gemensam energipolitik.
I dessa fall skall gemenskapen ta vederbörlig hänsyn till Islands intressen. För detta ändamål skall gemenskapen underrätta den gemensamma kommittén som skall sammanträda enligt de i artikel 32 angivna villkoren.
Island förbehåller sig rätten att vidta liknande åtgärder om samma situation skulle uppstå.
Avtalet skall inte utgöra hinder för de inte taxeanknutna bestämmelser, som tillämpas för importer av petroleumvaror, om inte annat följer av punkt 1 och 2.
De avtalsslutande parterna förklarar, att de är beredda att, så långt som deras jordbrukspolitik tillåter, främja en harmonisk utveckling av handeln med de jordbruksvaror som inte omfattas av avtalet.
De avtalsslutande parterna skall tillämpa sina bestämmelser i fråga om veterinära ärenden, hälsofrågor och växtskydd på ett icke-diskriminerande sätt och inte införa några nya åtgärder som otillbörligen kan hindra handeln.
De avtalsslutande parterna skall enligt de villkor som anges i artikel 33 undersöka alla svårigheter som kan uppstå i deras handel med jordbruksprodukter och skall sträva efter att finna lämpliga lösningar.
Från och med den 1 juli 1977 får varor med ursprung i Island inte gynnas av en mera förmånlig behandling, när de importeras till gemenskapen, än den som medlemsstaterna i gemenskapen tillämpar sinsemellan.
Protokoll nr 6 fastställer särskilda bestämmelser som gäller för importer av vissa fiskprodukter till gemenskapen.
Avtalet skall inte utesluta att tullunioner, frihandelsområden eller avtal om gränshandel behålls eller upprättas utom i den mån de ändrar de handelsarrangemang som föreskrivs i detta avtal, särskilt bestämmelserna om ursprungsregler.
De avtalsslutande parterna skall avstå från varje åtgärd eller förfarande av inhemsk fiskal karaktär som medför direkt eller indirekt diskriminering mellan en avtalsparts varor och samma varor med ursprung i den andra avtalspartens territorium.
Varor som exporteras till ett av avtalsparternas territorier får inte gynnas av återbetalning av inhemska skatter utöver det belopp som direkt eller indirekt ålagts dem.
Betalningar avseende handel med varor och överföringen av dessa betalningar till den medlemsstat i gemenskapen i vilken borgenären är bosatt eller till Island skall vara befriade från alla restriktioner.
Avtalet skall inte utesluta de förbud eller restriktioner för importer, exporter eller varor under transitering som är berättigade på grund av allmän moral, lag och ordning eller allmän säkerhet, skydd till liv och hälsa för människor, djur och växter, bevarandet av nationella skatter av konstnärligt, historiskt eller arkeologiskt värde, skydd av immateriell eller kommersiell egendom eller bestämmelser avseende guld eller silver.
Dessa förbud eller restriktioner skall dock inte utgöra ett medel för godtycklig diskriminering eller en förtäckt handelsrestriktion mellan de avtalsslutande parterna.
Ingenting i avtalet skall hindra en avtalspart att vidta åtgärder a) som den anser nödvändiga för att förhindra att information, som strider mot dess väsentliga säkerhetsintressen, avslöjas,
b) som avser handel med vapen, ammunition eller krigsmaterial eller forskning, utveckling eller tillverkning som är nödvändig för försvarsändamål, under förutsättning att dessa åtgärder inte försämrar konkurrensvillkoren i fråga om varor som inte är avsedda för uttryckligen militära ändamål,
c) som den anser väsentliga för dess egen säkerhet i krigstid eller under ett allvarligt internationellt spänningsläge.
Avtalsparterna skall avstå från att vidta varje åtgärd som är ägnad att äventyra att avtalets mål uppfylls.
De skall vidta alla allmänna eller särskilda åtgärder som krävs för att uppfylla sina förpliktelser enligt avtalet.
Om någon av avtalsparterna anser att den andra avtalsparten har försummat att uppfylla ett villkor i avtalet, får den vidta lämpliga åtgärder enligt de villkor och förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 28.
Följande är oförenligt med avtalet i den mån det kan påverka handeln mellan gemenskapen och Island: i) Alla avtal mellan företag, beslut av företagssammanslutningar och samordnade förfaranden mellan företag som har som mål eller verkan att hindra, begränsa eller snedvrida konkurrensen beträffande tillverkning av eller handel med varor.
ii) Missbruk av ett eller flera företag med dominerande ställning i de avtalsslutande parternas territorier i hela eller en väsentlig del av dessa territorier.
iii) Varje offentlig stödåtgärd som snedvrider eller hotar att snedvrida konkurrensen genom att gynna vissa företag eller tillverkningen av vissa varor.
Om en avtalspart anser att ett visst förfarande är oförenligt med denna artikel, får den vidta lämpliga åtgärder enligt de villkor och de förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 28.
Om en ökning av importen av en viss vara är eller sannolikt är till allvarligt förfång för varje tillverkningsverksamhet som bedrivs i ett av avtalsparternas territorier, får den berörda avtalsparten vidta lämpliga åtgärder enligt de villkor och förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 28, om denna ökning beror på
i) delvis eller hel nedsättning hos den importerande avtalsparten, enligt avtalet, av tullar och avgifter med motsvarande verkan som påförts varan i fråga, och
ii) det faktum att de tullar eller avgifter med motsvarande verkan som den exporterande avtalsparten påfört importer av råmaterial eller halvfabrikat som används i tillverkningen av varan i fråga är väsentligt lägre än de motsvarande tullarna eller avgifterna som påförts av den importerande avtalsparten.
Om en av avtalsparterna anser att dumpning sker i handeln med den andra avtalsparten, får den vidta lämpliga åtgärder gentemot denna dumping enligt Avtalet om tillämpning av artikel 6 i Allmänna tull- och handelsavtalet, enligt de villkor och förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 28.
Om allvarliga störningar uppstår i en ekonomisk sektor eller om svårigheter uppstår som kan medföra allvarlig försvagning av det ekonomiska läget i en region, får den berörda avtalsparten vidta lämpliga åtgärder enligt de villkor och förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 28.
I händelse av att en avtalspart gör importer av varor, som lätt kan ge upphov till de i artikel 25 och 27 angivna svårigheterna, till föremål för ett administrativt förfarande, vars syfte är att ge snabb information om handelstrenden skall den upplysa den andra avtalsparten om detta.
I de fall, som närmare anges i artiklarna 23 till 27, innan de där föreskrivna åtgärderna vidtas eller i de fall, som omfattas av punkt 3.d, skall den berörda avtalsparten så snart som möjligt förse den gemensamma kommittén med alla relevanta uppgifter, som behövs för en noggrann undersökning av läget, i syfte att finna en godtagbar lösning för avtalsparterna.
I valet av åtgärder skall de som orsakar minst störningar för avtalet prioriteras.
Säkerhetsåtgärderna skall genast anmälas till den gemensamma kommittén och skall vara föremål för periodiska samråd inom kommittén, särskilt i syfte att upphäva dem så snart som förhållandena medger.
Vid genomförandet av punkt 2 skall följande bestämmelser tillämpas: a) Beträffande artikel 24 får endera avtalsparten hänvisa ärendet till den gemensamma kommittén, om den anser att ett visst förfarande är oförenligt med avtalets rätta funktion enligt artikel 24.1.
Avtalsparterna skall förse den gemensamma kommittén med alla relevanta upplysningar och ge den det stöd den kräver för att undersöka fallet och, i förekommande fall, avbryta det förfarande mot vilket invändningen har gjorts.
Om den berörda avtalsparten inte lyckas avbryta det förfarande mot vilket invändning gjorts inom den tid som den gemensamma kommittén fastställt eller, i brist på enighet i den gemensamma kommittén, inom tre månader efter det att ärendet har hänskjutits till den, får den berörda avtalsparten vidta alla de säkerhetsåtgärder den anser nödvändiga för att hantera de allvarliga svårigheter som uppstått på grund av förfarandet i fråga. Den får framförallt återta gjorda tulleftergifter.
b) Beträffande artikel 25 skall de svårigheter, som uppstår ur den situation som anges i denna artikel, för undersökning hänskjutas till den gemensamma kommittén, som får fatta varje beslut som är nödvändigt för att undanröja dessa svårigheter.
Om den gemensamma kommittén eller den exporterande avtalsparten inte, inom trettio dagar efter det att ärendet har hänskjutits till kommittén, har fattat ett beslut för att undanröja svårigheterna, har den importerande avtalsparten rätt att påföra den importerade varan en kompensationsavgift.
Kompensationsavgiften skall med hänsyn till mängdförhållandet beräknas på de berörda varornas värde i fråga om tullskillnaderna på det råmaterial eller de halvfabrikat som ingår i dem.
c) Beträffande artikel 26 skall samråd i den gemensamma kommittén ske, innan de berörda avtalsparterna vidtar lämpliga åtgärder.
d) Om extraordinära omständigheter kräver omedelbar handling och en undersökning i förväg därför inte är möjlig, får den berörda avtalsparten vid de tillfällen, som anges i artikel 25-27 och även i fall av exportstöd som har en direkt och omedelbar verkan på handeln, omedelbart tillämpa de försiktighetsåtgärder som är absolut nödvändiga för att rätta till situationen.
Om en eller flera av gemenskapens medlemsstater eller Island har svårigheter eller allvarligt hotas av svårigheter med betalningsbalansen, får den berörda avtalsparten vidta nödvändiga säkerhetsåtgärder.
Den skall omedelbart underrätta den andra avtalsparten.
En gemensam kommitté upprättas som skall ansvara för förvaltningen av avtalet och säkerställa att det genomförs på ett riktigt sätt.
För detta ändamål skall den avge rekommendationer och fatta beslut i de fall som föreskrivs i avtalet.
Dessa beslut skall genomföras av avtalsparterna enligt deras egna bestämmelser.
För att avtalet skall genomföras på ett riktigt sätt, skall avtalsparterna utbyta upplysningar och överläggningar skall på begäran av endera parten ske i den gemensamma kommittén.

Den gemensamma kommittén får fatta beslut om att inrätta arbetsgrupper som kan bistå kommittén i dess arbetsuppgifter.
Om en avtalspart anser att det skulle vara i bägge avtalsparternas gemensamma intresse att utveckla de förbindelser, som fastställs i avtalet genom att utöka dem till områden som inte omfattas i avtalet, skall den överlämna en motiverad framställning till den andra avtalsparten.
Avtalsparterna får instruera den gemensamma kommittén att undersöka denna framställning och att i förekommande fall avge rekommendationer till dem, särskilt i syfte att inleda förhandlingar.

EUROPEISKA AVTALET OM UTBYTE AV VÄVNADSBESTÄMMANDE REAGENSER
MEDLEMSSTATERNA I EUROPARÅDET SOM UNDERTECKNAR DETTA AVTAL HAR
med beaktande av att vävnadsbestämmande reagenser inte är tillgängliga i obegränsade kvantiteter,
med beaktande av att det är mycket önskvärt att medlemsstater i en anda av europeisk solidaritet bistår varandra i fråga om dessa vävnadsbestämmande reagenser om behov skulle uppstå,
med beaktande av att sådant ömsesidigt bistånd endast är möjligt om egenskaperna hos och användningen av sådana vävnadsbestämmande reagenser är föremål för regler som fastställs gemensamt av medlemsstaterna och om de nödvändiga importlättnaderna och tullfriheten beviljas,
KOMMIT ÖVERENS OM FÖLJANDE.
I detta avtal avses med uttrycket vävnadsbestämmande reagenser sådana reagenser av mänskligt ursprung, från djurriket, växtriket eller av annat ursprung som används för vävnadsbestämning.
Bestämmelserna i artikel 2-6 i detta avtal skall också gälla för celler med känd antigensammansättning som skall användas för undersökning av vävnadsbestämmande reagenser.
De avtalsslutande parterna åtar sig, under förutsättning att de har tillräckliga lager för sina egna behov, att göra vävnadsbestämmande reagenser tillgängliga för andra parter som behöver dem och att endast ta ut de kostnader de haft för insamling, behandling och transport av dessa ämnen samt eventuell kostnad för förvärvet av dem.
Vävnadsbestämmande reagenser skall göras tillgängliga för de övriga avtalsslutande parterna på villkor att ingen vinst görs på dem och att de används enbart för medicinska och vetenskapliga ändamål, dvs. icke-kommersiella ändamål och skall levereras endast till laboratorier som utsetts av de berörda regeringarna enligt artikel 6 i detta avtal.
De avtalsslutande parterna skall bekräfta att de bestämmelser som fastställs i protokollet till detta avtal har iakttagits.
De skall också uppfylla alla de bestämmelser de förbundit sig att iaktta med hänsyn till internationell standardisering inom detta område.
Alla försändelser med vävnadsbestämmande reagenser skall åtföljas av ett certifikat som intygar att de beretts enligt specifikationerna i protokollet.
Detta certifikat skall bygga på den förlaga som återfinns i bilagan till protokollet.
Protokollet och dess bilaga utgör ett administrativt arrangemang och får ändras eller utökas av regeringarna i de länder som är parter i detta avtal.
De avtalsslutande parterna skall vidta alla nödvändiga åtgärder för att undanta de vävnadsbestämmande reagenser som ställs till deras förfogande av de andra parterna från alla importtullar.
De skall också vidta alla nödvändiga åtgärder för snabb leverans av dessa ämnen via närmsta väg till mottagarna enligt artikel 3 i detta avtal.
De avtalsslutande parterna skall genom Europarådets generalsekreterare till varandra överlämna en förteckning över de nationella eller regionala referenslaboratorier som bemyndigats att utfärda de certifikat som föreskrivs i artikel 4 i avtalet och att distribuera importerade vävnadsbestämmande reagenser.
Detta avtal skall vara öppet för undertecknande av Europarådets medlemsstater, vilka får bli avtalsslutande part antingen genom a) undertecknande utan reservation i fråga om ratificering eller godkännande eller
b) undertecknande med reservation i fråga om ratificering eller godkännande, efterföljt av ratificering eller godkännande.
Instrument för ratificering eller godkännande skall deponeras hos Europarådets generalsekreterare.
Detta avtal träder i kraft en månad efter den dag då tre av rådets medlemsstater har blivit parter i avtalet enligt bestämmelserna i artikel 7.
Vad gäller varje medlemsstat som därefter undertecknar avtalet utan reservation i fråga om ratificering eller godkännande eller som skall ratificera eller godkänna det, träder avtalet i kraft en månad efter den dag det undertecknades eller efter den dag instrumentet för ratificering eller godkännande deponerades.
Efter det att detta avtal trätt i kraft får Europarådets ministerkommitté inbjuda alla icke-medlemsstater att ansluta sig till avtalet.
Denna anslutning skall genomföras genom deposition hos Europarådets generalsekreterare av ett anslutningsinstrument som skall träda i kraft en månad efter dagen för depositionen.
Varje avtalsslutande part får vid tidpunkten för undertecknandet eller då instrumentet för ratificering, godkännande eller anslutning deponeras ange vilket eller vilka territorier avtalet skall omfatta.
Då instrumentet för ratificering, godkännande eller anslutning deponeras eller vid en senare tidpunkt, får varje avtalsslutande part genom en deklaration ställd till Europarådets generalsekreterare utöka detta avtal till annat eller andra territorier som anges i deklarationen, för vars internationella relationer den är ansvarig eller på vars vägnar den är befullmäktigad att träffa avtal.
Varje deklaration som gjorts till följd av punkt 2 får, med avseende på varje territorium som nämns i denna deklaration, upphävas enligt förfarandet i artikel 11 i detta avtal.
Varje avtalsslutande part får i den utsträckning den är berörd säga upp detta avtal genom en anmälan ställd till Europarådets generalsekreterare.
Denna uppsägning träder i kraft sex månader efter den dag denna anmälan mottagits av generalsekreteraren.
Europarådets generalsekreterare skall underrätta rådets medlemsstater och varje stat som har anslutit sig till avtalet om a) varje underskrift utan reservation i fråga om ratificering eller godkännande,

Följande skall utgå: - "
TULLKONVENTION OM INTERNATIONELL TRANSPORT AV GODS UPPTAGET I TIR-CARNET (TIR-KONVENTION)
SOM ÖNSKAR UNDERLÄTTA internationell transport av gods med vägfordon,
SOM ANSER att transportvillkorens förbättring utgör en väsentlig faktor för utvecklingen av samarbetet mellan dem,
SOM FÖRORDAR en förenkling och harmonisering av de administrativa formaliteterna på det internationella transportområdet, i synnerhet vid gränserna,
a) Definitioner
I denna konvention avses med: a) "TIR-operation" godstransport från en avgångstullanstalt till en bestämmelsetullanstalt enligt det i denna konvention angivna förfarandet, kallat "TIR-förfarandet";
b) "tullar och andra avgifter vid import eller export" tullar och alla andra skatter, avgifter eller andra pålagor som uppbäres vid eller i samband med import eller export av varor; uttrycket omfattar dock ej avgifter och pålagor som begränsas till de ungefärliga kostnaderna för utförda tjänster; c)
"vägfordon" ej endast varje motordrivet vägfordon utan också varje påhängsvagn eller annan släpvagn avsedd att kopplas till ett sådant vägfordon;
d) "fordonskombination" sammankopplade fordon som framföres på vägen såsom en enhet;
e) "container" en transportanordning, möbelbehållare, flyttbar tank eller annan anordning av liknande konstruktion): i) helt eller delvis tillsluten för att bilda ett godsutrymme; ii)
av varaktigt slag och följaktligen tillräckligt hållbar för att lämpa sig för upprepad användning;
iii) särskilt konstruerad för att underlätta godstransport med ett eller flera transportsätt utan omlastning under vägen;
iv) konstruerad för att kunna hanteras bekvämt, i synnerhet vid ombyte av transportsätt; v)
konstruerad så att den är lätt att fylla och tömma; och
vi) med en inre volym av minst en kubikmeter;
"Utbytbara karosserier" skall behandlas så som containrar;
f) "avgångstullanstalt" varje tullanstalt inom fördragsslutande parts område, vid vilken internationell transport enligt TIR-förfarandet av last eller del därav börjar;
g) "bestämmelsetullanstalt" varje tullanstalt inom fördragsslutande parts område, vid vilken internationell transport enligt TIR-förfarandet av last eller del därav slutar;
h) "mellanliggande tullanstalt" varje tullanstalt inom fördragsslutande parts område vid vilken vägfordon, fordonskombinationer eller containrar införes eller utföres under en TIR-operation;
j) "person" såväl fysisk som juridisk person; k)
"tungt eller skrymmande gods" varje tungt eller skrymmande föremål som på grund av sin vikt, storlek eller beskaffenhet ej normalt befordras i ett tillslutet vägfordon eller i en tillsluten container; l)
"garanterande sammanslutning" en sammanslutning som av fördragsslutande parts tullmyndigheter godkänts att uppträda såsom garant för personer som använder TIR-förfarandet;
b) Tillämpningsområde
Denna konvention avser godstransport utan omlastning under vägen över en eller flera gränser från avgångstullanstalt inom en fördragsslutande parts område till bestämmelsetullanstalt inom annan eller samma fördragsslutande parts område, i vägfordon, fordonskombinationer eller containrar, förutsatt att någon del av färden mellan början och slutet av TIR-operationen företas på väg.
skall transportoperationerna utföras i) med vägfordon, fordonskombinationer eller containrar som i förväg godkänts enligt de villkor som anges i kapitel III a); eller
ii) med andra vägfordon, andra fordonskombinationer eller andra containrar enligt de villkor som anges i kapitel III c); b)
skall transportoperationerna garanteras av sammanslutningar som godkänts enligt bestämmelserna i artikel 6 och för operationerna användas en TIR-carnet som skall stämma överens med modellen i bilaga 1 till denna konvention.
c) Principer
För gods som befordras enligt TIR-förfarandet skall erläggande eller deposition av tullar och andra avgifter vid import eller export ej krävas vid mellanliggande tullanstalter.
Gods som befordras enligt TIR-förfarandet i förseglade vägfordon, fordonskombinationer eller containrar skall som regel ej bli föremål för undersökning vid mellanliggande tullanstalter.
För att förhindra missbruk kan tullmyndigheterna likväl i exceptionella fall och särskilt när oegentligheter befaras företaga en undersökning av godset vid sådana anstalter.
KAPITEL II UTFÄRDANDE AV TIR-CARNETER GARANTERADE SAMMANSLUTNINGARS ANSVARIGHET
På de villkor och mot sådan garanti, som varje fördragsslutande part själv bestämmer, kan parten medge sammanslutningar rätt att antingen själva eller genom motsvarande sammanslutningar utfärda TIR-carneter och att uppträda såsom garanter.
En sammanslutning skall ej godtagas i ett land, såvida icke dess garanti täcker också det betalningsansvar som kan uppstå inom landet i fråga i samband med transporter för vilka används TIR-carneter, som utfärdats av utländska sammanslutningar, anslutna till samma internationella organisation som den själv är ansluten till.
Blanketter till TIR-carneter, som sänds till garanterande sammanslutningar från motsvarande utländska sammanslutningar eller från internationella organisationer, skall ej beläggas med tullar och andra avgifter vid import eller export och skall vara fria från förbud och begränsningar vid import och export.
Den garanterande sammanslutningen skall förbinda sig att erlägga de tullar och andra avgifter vid import eller export, jämte eventuell dröjsmålsränta, som skall betalas enligt tullförfattningarna i det land där en oegentlighet uppmärksammats i samband med en TIR-operation.
Sammanslutningen skall solidariskt med de personer som det åligger att betala ovannämnda belopp ansvara för erläggandet av dessa.
Om en fördragsslutande parts lagar och förordningar ej föreskriver att tullar och andra avgifter vid import eller export skall erläggas enligt moment 1 ovan, skall den garanterande sammanslutningen förbinda sig att på samma villkor erlägga ett belopp som motsvarar summan av tullarna och de andra avgifterna vid import eller export samt den eventuella dröjsmålsräntan.
Varje fördragsslutande part skall bestämma det högsta belopp per TIR-carnet som kan krävas från den garanterande sammanslutningen på grundval av bestämmelserna i moment 1 och 2 ovan.
Den garanterande sammanslutningens ansvarighet gentemot myndigheterna i det land där avgångstullanstalten är belägen skall börja att gälla från den tidpunkt då TIR-carneten godtages av tullanstalten.
I de länder som passeras senare och genom vilka gods transporteras enligt TIR-förfarandet skall denna ansvarighet börja att gälla vid den tidpunkt då godset föres in eller, om TIR-operationen avbrutits enligt moment 1 och 2 av artikel 26, vid den tidpunkt då TIR-carneten godtages av den tullanstalt där TIR-operationen återupptages.
Den garanterande sammanslutningens ansvarighet skall gälla icke endast sådant gods som är upptaget i TIR-carneten utan också sådant gods som finns i den förseglade delen av vägfordonet eller i den förseglade containern utan att vara upptaget i carneten.
Ansvarigheten skall ej omfatta annat gods.
Vid beräknandet av de tullar och andra avgifter, som nämnes i moment 1 och 2 av denna artikel, skall de uppgifter om godset som antecknats i TIR-carneten anses riktiga om ej annat bevisas.
När belopp, som nämnes i moment 1 och 2 av denna artikel skall betalas, skall de behöriga myndigheterna i så stor utsträckning som möjligt kräva betalning från den person eller de personer som är direkt ansvariga, innan den garanterande sammanslutningen kräves.
Den garanterande sammanslutningen skall fastställa TIR-carnetens giltighetstid genom att ange sista giltighetsdag efter vilken carneten ej kan visas upp och godtagas vid avgångstullanstalten.
Förutsatt att carneten godtagits av avgångstullanstalten senast sista giltighetsdagen i enlighet med moment 1 av denna artikel, skall carneten förbli giltig till dess TIR-operationen avslutats vid bestämmelsetullanstalten.
TIR-carneten kan avstämplas med eller utan förbehåll; om avstämpling gjorts med förbehåll skall detta ha gjorts med anledning av omständigheter som har samband med själva TIR-operationen.
Dessa omständigheter skall klart anges i TIR-carneten.
När tullmyndigheterna i ett land avstämplat en TIR-carnet utan förbehåll, kan de ej längre kräva betalning av de belopp som nämnes i moment 1 och 2 av artikel 8 från den garanterande sammanslutningen, såvida ej avstämplingsbeviset erhållits på ett oegentligt eller bedrägligt sätt.
När en TIR-carnet ej avstämplats eller avstämplats med förbehåll, skall de behöriga myndigheterna ej ha rätt att kräva betalning av de belopp som nämnes i moment 1 och 2 av artikel 8 från den garanterande sammanslutningen, såvida ej myndigheter inom en tid av ett år från den dag då TIR-carneten godtagits av dem skriftligen underrättat sammanslutningen om att avstämpling ej skett eller gjorts med förbehåll.
Samma bestämmelse skall gälla när avstämplingsbeviset erhållits på ett oegentligt eller bedrägligt sätt, utom att tidsfristen då skall vara två år.
Betalning av belopp, som avses i moment 1 och 2 av artikel 8, skall krävas från den garanterande sammanslutningen tidigast tre månader efter den dag då sammanslutningen underrättades om att carneten ej avstämplats eller avstämplats med förbehåll eller att avstämplingsbeviset erhållits på ett oegentligt eller bedrägligt sätt och senast två år efter denna dag.
I de fall som under ovannämnda tidsfrist av två år blir föremål för laga åtgärder skall emellertid betalning krävas inom ett år från den dag då domstolsutslaget vunnit laga kraft.
Den garanterande sammanslutningen skall ha en tidsfrist av tre månader från den dag då densamma krävdes på betalning för att erlägga de krävda beloppen.
De erlagda beloppen skall återbetalas till sammanslutningen om det inom två år efter den dag, då betalning krävdes, styrkes på sätt som tullmyndigheterna finner tillfredsställande att någon oegentlighet ej ägt rum i anslutning till ifrågavarande transportoperation.
KAPITEL III TRANSPORT AV GODS UPPTAGET I TIR-CARNET
a) Godkännande av fordon och containrar
För att täckas av bestämmelserna i avsnitten a) och b) av detta kapitel måste varje vägfordon uppfylla de krav beträffande dess konstruktion och utrustning som anges i bilaga 2 till denna konvention och ha godkänts enligt det förfarande som anges i bilaga 3 till denna konvention.
Godkännandebeviset skall stämma överens med den modell som återges i bilaga 4.
För att täckas av bestämmelserna i avsnitten a) och b) av detta kapitel måste containrar vara konstruerade i överensstämmelse med de krav som anges i del I av bilaga 7 och ha godkänts enligt det förfarande som anges i del II av samma bilaga.
Containrar som är godkända för transport av gods under tullförsegling enligt 1956 års tullkonvention om godsbehållare, enligt därefter tillkomna överenskommelser som slutits under Förenta Nationernas beskydd, enligt 1972 års tullkonvention om containrar eller enligt andra internationella instrument som kan komma att ersätta eller ändra den senare konventionen skall anses uppfylla bestämmelserna i moment 1 ovan och måste godtagas för transport enligt TIR-förfarandet utan ytterligare godkännande.
Varje fördragsslutande part förbehåller sig rätten att vägra erkänna giltigheten av ett godkännande av sådana vägfordon eller containrar som ej uppfyller villkoren i artiklarna 12 och 13 ovan.
Fördragsslutande parter skall emellertid undvika att fördröja trafiken när de konstaterade bristerna är av mindre betydelse och ej innebär någon smugglingsrisk.
Vägfordon eller containrar, som ej längre uppfyller de villkor som berättigade deras godkännande, skall antingen återställas i sitt ursprungliga skick eller visas upp för förnyat godkännande, innan de användes igen för transport av gods under tullförsegling.
b) Förfarande för transport av gods upptaget i TIR-carnet
Något särskilt tulldokument skall ej erfordras för den temporära införseln av ett vägfordon, en kombination av vägfordon eller en container som befordrar gods enligt TIR-förfarandet.
Någon garanti skall ej erfordras för vägfordonet, fordonskombinationen eller containern.
Bestämmelserna i moment 1 av denna artikel skall ej hindra en fördragsslutande part att vid bestämmelsetullanstalten kräva fullgörandet av de formaliteter som föreskrives i dess nationella författningar för att försäkra sig om att vägfordonet, fordonskombinationen eller containern kommer att återutföras, när TIR-operationen avslutats.
När ett vägfordon eller en fordonskombination användes för en TIR-operation skall en rektangulär skylt med beteckningen "TIR" och utformad i överensstämmelse med anvisningarna i bilaga 5 till denna konvention vara fästad framtill och en annan baktill på fordonet eller fordonskombinationen.
Dessa skyltar skall vara placerade så, att de är klart synliga och skall vara löstagbara.
En TIR-carnet skall utfärdas för varje vägfordon eller container.
En gemensam TIR-carnet kan emellertid utfärdas för en fordonskombination eller för flera containrar, som lastats på samma vägfordon eller på samma fordonskombination.
I sådant fall skall TIR-manifestet för det gods som TIR-carneten gäller ta upp innehållet i varje fordon i fordonskombination eller i varje container särskilt.
TIR-carneten skall gälla för endast en färd.
Den skall innehålla minst det antal frånskiljbara kuponger för tullmyndigheternas instämpling och avstämpling som erfordras för transportoperationen i fråga.
En TIR-operation kan omfatta flera avgångs- och bestämmelsetullanstalter; dock gäller, om ej annat bestämts av vederbörande fördragsslutande part eller parter, a) att avgångstullanstalterna skall vara belägna i endast ett land;
b) att bestämmelsetullanstalterna ej skall vara belägna i mer än två länder; c)
att det sammanlagda antalet avgångs- och bestämmelsetullanstalter ej får överstiga fyra.
Godset samt vägfordonet, fordonskombinationen eller containern skall tillsammans med TIR-carneten visas upp vid avgångstullanstalten.
Tullmyndigheterna i avgångslandet skall vidtaga sådana åtgärder som erfordras för att de skall kunna förvissa sig om godsmanifestets riktighet och för att antingen anbringa tullförseglingar eller kontrollera tullförseglingar som på dessa tullmyndigheters ansvar anbragts av vederbörligen godkända personer.
För färd inom ett land kan dess tullmyndigheter fastställa en tidsfrist och kräva att vägfordonet, fordonskombinationen eller containern skall följa en bestämd färdväg.
Vid varje mellanliggande tullanstalt och vid bestämmelsetullanstalterna skall vägfordonet, fordonskombinationen eller containern visas upp för att kontrolleras av tullmyndigheterna tillsammans med lasten och den TIR-carnet som upptar lasten.
Varje fördragsslutande parts tullmyndigheter vid mellanliggande tullanstalter skall som regel, utom då de undersöker godset enligt moment 2 av artikel 5, godtaga andra fördragsslutande parters tullförseglingar förutsatt att de är i orubbat skick.
Dessa tullmyndigheter kan emellertid dessutom anbringa egna förseglingar om kraven på kontroll gör detta nödvändigt.
De tullförseglingar som sålunda godtagits av en fördragsslutande part skall inom denna parts område åtnjuta samma lagliga skydd som nationella tullförseglingar.
Tullmyndigheterna skall ej, utom i särskilda fall, P kräva att vägfordon, fordonskombinationer eller containrar åtföljes av bevakning på fraktförares bekostnad inom det egna landet
P kräva undersökning av vägfordon, fordonskombinationer eller containrar och deras last under färd.
Om tullmyndigheterna undersöker lasten på ett vägfordon, en fordonskombination eller en container under färd eller vid en mellanliggande tullanstalt, skall de anteckna uppgifter om de nya förseglingarna och om de företagna undersökningarna på de kuponger i TIR-carneten som är avsedda för det egna landet, på motsvarande talonger (souches) och på de kuponger som finns kvar i TIR-carneten.
Om tullförsegling brytes under färd i andra fall än de som anges i artiklarna 24 och 35, eller om gods förstörs eller skadas utan att försegling brytes, skall P utan att eventuell tillämpning av nationell lagstiftning därigenom inskränkes P det förfarande som föreskrives i bilaga 1 till denna konvention om användningen av TIR-carneten följas och den bestyrkta rapporten i TIR-carneten fyllas i.
När en transport på TIR-carnet delvis äger rum inom en stat som ej är ansluten till denna konvention, skall TIR-operationen avbrytas under den delen av färden.
I sådant fall skall tullmyndigheterna inom den fördragsslutande parts område där färden fortsätter godtaga TIR-carneten för återupptagandet av TIR-operationen, förutsatt att tullförseglingarna och/eller identifieringsmärkena förblivit i orubbat skick.
Detsamma skall gälla när innehavaren av TIR-carneten ej använder carneten för viss del av färden inom en fördragsslutande parts område på grund av att det finns enklare transiteringsförfaranden eller när det ej är nödvändigt att använda sig av ett transiteringsförfarande.
I sådana fall skall de tullanstalter där TIR-operationen avbrytes eller återupptages anses vara mellanliggande utförselrespektive införseltullanstalter.
Under förutsättning att bestämmelserna i denna konvention och i synnerhet i artikel 18 är uppfyllda kan en annan bestämmelsetullanstalt ersätta den som ursprungligen angetts.
När lasten anländer till bestämmelsetullanstalten och förutsatt att godset då anmäles till ett annat tullförfarande eller förtullas, skall TIR-carneten avstämplas utan dröjsmål.
c) Bestämmelser om transport av tungt eller skrymm- ande gods
Bestämmelserna i detta avsnitt gäller endast transport av tungt eller skrymmande gods enligt definitionen i artikel 1 k) i denna konvention.
Om bestämmelserna i detta avsnitt tillämpas, kan tungt eller skrymmande gods befordras med oförseglade fordon eller containrar om myndigheterna vid avgångstullanstalten så bestämmer.
Bestämmelserna i detta avsnitt skall tillämpas endast om det befordrade tunga eller skrymmande godset jämte tillbehör enligt avgångstullanstaltens uppfattning lätt kan identifieras genom lämnad beskrivning eller kan förses med tullförseglingar och/eller identifieringsmärken för att förhindra att godset bytes ut eller föres bort utan att det lätt kan uppdagas.
Samtliga bestämmelser i denna konvention utom sådana som undantages genom de särskilda bestämmelserna i detta avsnitt skall gälla transport av tungt eller skrymmande gods enligt TIR-förfarandet.
Den garanterande sammanslutningens ansvar skall gälla inte endast det gods som upptagits i TIR-carneten utan också gods som utan att vara upptaget i carneten finns på lastflaket eller bland det gods som upptagits i TIR-carneten.
Carnetomslaget och samtliga kuponger i TIR-carneten skall vara försedda med påskriften "tungt eller skrymmande gods" i kraftiga bokstäver på engelska eller franska ().
Myndigheterna vid avgångstullanstalten kan kräva att sådana packlistor, fotografier, ritningar etc. som erfordras för identifiering av det befordrade godset skall fogas till TIRcarneten.
I sådant fall skall myndigheterna förse dessa handlingar med en påteckning, och ett exemplar av dessa handlingar skall fästas vid carnetomslagets andra sida varjämte samtliga manifest i TIR-carneten skall innehålla en hänvisning till handlingarna i fråga.
Varje fördragsslutande parts tullmyndigheter vid mellanliggande tullanstalter skall godtaga de tullförseglingar och/eller identifieringsmärken som anbragts av andra fördragsslutande parters behöriga myndigheter.
Tullmyndigheterna kan emellertid anbringa ytterligare förseglingar och/eller identifieringsmärken: de skall anteckna uppgifter om de nya förseglingarna och/eller identifieringsmärkena på de kuponger i TIR-carneten som är avsedda för det egna landet, på motsvarande talonger (souches) och på de kuponger som finns kvar i TIR-carneten.
Om tullmyndigheter som undersöker lasten vid en mellanliggande tullanstalt eller under färd är tvungna att bryta förseglingar och/eller taga bort identifieringsmärken, skall de anteckna uppgifter om de nya förseglingarna och/eller identifieringsmärkena på de kuponger i TIR-carneten som är avsedda för det egna landet, på motsvarande talonger (souches) och på de kuponger som finns kvar i TIR-carneten.
KAPITEL IV OEGENTLIGHETER
Varje överträdelse av bestämmelserna i denna konvention skall i det land där förseelsen ägt rum medföra de straffpåföljder för den skyldige som detta lands lag föreskriver.
När det icke är möjligt att fastställa inom vilken fördragsslutande parts område en oegentlighet begåtts, skall den anses ha ägt rum inom den fördragsslutande parts område där den upptäcktes.
Varje fördragsslutande part skall ha rätt att från förmåner enligt denna konvention tillfälligt eller för all framtid utesluta varje person, som gjort sig skyldig till allvarlig överträdelse av de tullförfattningar som gäller internationell godstransport.
Sådan uteslutning skall omedelbart anmälas till tullmyndigheterna hos den fördragsslutande part inom vilkens område personen i fråga driver sin rörelse eller är bosatt samt till den garanterande sammanslutningen (de garanterande sammanslutningarna) i det land där överträdelsen ägt rum.
När TIR-operationer anses i övrigt fullgjorda på riktigt sätt:
1. skall de fördragsslutande parterna bortse från mindre avvikelser från föreskrivna tidsfrister och färdvägar,
2. skall ej heller skiljaktigheter mellan uppgifterna i TIR-carnetens godsmanifest och det verkliga innehållet i ett vägfordon, en fordonskombination eller en container betraktas som om innehavaren av TIR-carneten brutit mot konventionen, då bevis förelägges på sätt behöriga myndigheter finner tillfredsställande att dessa skiljaktigheter ej berott på fel som begåtts medvetet eller av vårdslöshet då godset lastades eller avsändes eller när manifestet fylldes i.
Tullmyndigheterna i avgångs- och bestämmelseländerna skall ej betrakta innehavaren av TIR-carneten såsom ansvarig för skiljaktigheter som eventuellt upptäcktes i dessa länder då skiljaktigheterna i själva verket har samband med tullförfaranden som föregått eller följt på en TIR-operation och i vilka innehavaren ej varit inblandad.
När det för tullmyndigheterna på ett tillfredsställande sätt styrkes att gods upptaget i en TIR-carnets manifest har förstörts eller oåterkalleligt förlorats till följd av olyckshändelse eller force majeure eller att kvantiteten minskat på grund av godsets beskaffenhet, skall befrielse från erläggande av normalt belöpande tullar och andra avgifter medges.
De av en TIR-operation berörda fördragsslutande parternas behöriga myndigheter skall, när en fördragsslutande part så begär och anger skälen därtill, lämna denna part alla tillgängliga upplysningar som erfordras för tillämpningen av bestämmelserna i artiklarna 39, 40 och 41 ovan.

Fördragsslutande parter skall i största möjliga utsträckning underlätta de åtgärder från tullens sida beträffande lättfördärvliga varor som vidtages vid tullanstalter.
Bestämmelserna i denna konvention skall ej utesluta tillämpningen av begränsningar eller kontrollåtgärder som stadgas i nationella föreskrifter av hänsyn till allmän moral, allmän säkerhet eller allmän hälsovård eller av hänsyn till djur- eller växtsjukdomar och ej heller upptagande av avgifter som kan debiteras med stöd av sådana föreskrifter.
Bestämmelserna i denna konvention skall icke utesluta tillämpningen av andra nationella eller internationella bestämmelser om transport.
Denna konvention skall ej utgöra något hinder för fördragsslutande parter som bildar en tullunion eller ekonomisk union att fastställa särskilda regler för transportoperationer som börjar eller slutar inom eller passerar genom deras områden under förutsättning att dessa regler ej minskar de lättnader som föreskrives i konventionen.
Denna konvention skall ej utgöra något hinder för tillämpning av de större lättnader som fördragsslutande parter medger eller kan vilja medge antingen på grund av unilaterala bestämmelser eller i kraft av bilaterala eller multilaterala överenskommelser, förutsatt att dessa lättnader ej hindrar tillämpningen av bestämmelserna i denna konvention och i synnerhet ej TIR-operationer.

PROTOKOLL om samarbete om bekämpning av förorening av Medelhavet av olja och andra skadliga ämnen vid krissituationer
DE AVTALSSLUTANDE PARTERNA I DETTA PROTOKOLL
SOM ÄR UNDERTECKNARE av konventionen om skydd av Medelhavet mot förorening,
SOM INSER att svår förorening av havet genom olja och andra skadliga ämnen i Medelhavet innebär en fara för kuststaterna och det marina ekosystemet,
SOM FINNER att samarbete mellan alla kuststater vid Medelhavet behövs för att bekämpa denna förorening,
SOM BEAKTAR den internationella konventionen om förebyggande av föroreningar från fartyg, av år 1973, den internationella konventionen som avser intervention på öppet hav i fall av oljeföroreningsolyckor, av år 1969, liksom protokollet avseende intervention på öppet hav i fall av oljeföroreningsolyckor i fall av marin förorening genom andra ämnen än olja, av vår 1973,
OCH SOM OCKSÅ TAR HÄNSYN TILL internationella konventionen om skadeståndsansvar för oljeföroreningsskador, 1969
HAR KOMMIT ÖVERENS OM FÖLJANDE.
De avtalsslutande parterna i detta protokoll, nedan kallade parterna, skall samarbeta för att vidta nödvändiga åtgärder i fall av allvarlig och omedelbart förestående fara för den marina miljön, kusten eller hithörande intressen från en eller flera av parterna orsakad förekomst av stora kvantiteter av olja eller andra skadliga ämnen som orsakats av olyckshändelse, eller en anhopning av små utsläpp som förorenar eller hotar att förorena havet inom det område som definieras i artikel 1 i konventionen för skydd av Medelhavet mot förgiftning (nedan kallad konventionen).
I detta protokoll avses med hithörande intressen de intressen som berör en kuststat som är omedelbart berörd eller hotad, och berör bland annat a) verksamheter i kustfarvatten, i hamnar eller flodmynningar, inklusive fiskeverksamhet,
b) det berörda områdets historiska och turistmässiga värde, inklusive vattensporter och fritidsaktiviteter,
c) kustbefolkningens hälsa,
d) bevarandet av levande resurser.
Parterna skall, antingen var för sig eller genom bilateralt eller multilateralt samarbete, sträva efter att vidmakthålla och främja sina katastrofplaner och medel för att bekämpa havsförorening orsakad av olja och andra skadliga ämnen.
Dessa medel skall särskilt innefatta utrustning, fartyg, flygplan och personal som är förberedda för verksamhet i nödsituationer.
Parterna skall, antingen var för sig eller genom bilateralt eller multilateralt samarbete, utveckla och tillämpa övervakningsmetoder för Medelhavsområdet, för att ha så fullständig information som möjligt om sådana situationer som avses i artikel 1 i detta protokoll.
När det gäller utsläpp eller förlust överbord av skadliga ämnen i paket, containrar, flyttbara tankar eller tankvagnar för vägeller järnvägstransport, skall parterna samarbeta så långt det är praktiskt möjligt vid bärgning och räddning av sådana ämnen för att minska risken för förorening av den marina miljön.
Varje part åtar sig att till de andra parterna sprida information om följande:
a) De behöriga nationella organisationer eller myndigheter som ansvarar för bekämpning av havsförorening orsakad av olja och andra skadliga ämnen. b) De behöriga nationella myndigheter som ansvarar för att ta emot rapporter om förorening av havet orsakad av olja och andra skadliga ämnen och för att ha hand om frågor som avser metoder för samverkan mellan parterna.
c) Nya sätt på vilka havsförorening orsakad av olja och andra skadliga ämnen kan undvikas och nya metoder för att bekämpa förorening samt utvecklingen av hithörande forskningsprogram.
Parter som överenskommit om att direkt utbyta information sinsemellan skall ändå vidarebefordra sådan information till det regionala centret.
Detta skall vidarebefordra informationen till de övriga parterna och, på ömsesidig grund, till kuststater vid Medelhavet som inte är parter i detta protokoll.
Parterna åtar sig att samordna de tillgängliga kommunikationsmedlen för att med nödvändig snabbhet och pålitlighet säkerställa mottagandet, överförandet och spridningen av alla rapporter och brådskande information som hänför sig till de händelser och situationer som anges i artikel 1.

Varje part skall utfärda instruktioner till befälhavare på fartyg som för dess flagga och till piloter på flygplan registrerade på dess territorium vilka ålägger dem att genom de snabbaste och pålitligaste kanalerna rapportera i enlighet med bilaga I till detta protokoll, antingen till någon part eller till det regionala centret a) alla olyckor som orsakar, eller kan förväntas orsaka, havsförorening av olja eller andra skadliga ämnen,
b) förekomst, typ och omfattning av utsläpp av olja eller andra skadliga ämnen som iakttagits till sjöss och som kan förväntas utgöra ett allvarligt och omedelbart hot mot den marina miljön eller mot kusterna eller hithörande intressen för en eller flera av parterna.
Den information som insamlats enligt punkt 1 skall vidarebefordras till de andra parter som kan förväntas bli påverkade av föroreningen a) av den part som erhållit informationen antingen direkt eller helst genom det regionala centret, eller
b) av det regionala centret.
I de fall då direkt kommunikation mellan parterna förekommer, skall det regionala centret informera om de åtgärder som vidtagits av dessa parter.
Tillämpningen av punkt 2 medför att parterna inte är bundna av den förpliktelse som fastställs i artikel 9.2 i konventionen.
En part som står inför en situation av den art som definieras i artikel 1 i detta protokoll skall a) göra nödvändiga uppskattningar av typ och omfattning av olyckan eller nödsituationen eller, om så påkallas, av typen och den ungefärliga mängden av olja eller andra skadliga ämnen samt riktningen och avdriftshastigheten hos utsläppet,
b) vidta alla praktiskt möjliga åtgärder för att undvika eller minska effekterna av utsläppet,
c) omedelbart informera alla andra parter, antingen direkt eller genom det regionala centret, om dessa uppskattningar och om de åtgärder den vidtagit eller avser att vidta för att bekämpa föroreningen,
d) fortsätta att observera situationen så länge som möjligt och rapportera därom i enlighet med artikel 8.
När åtgärder vidtas för att bekämpa förorening som härrör från ett fartyg, skall alla tänkbara åtgärder vidtas för att skydda personerna ombord och, så långt möjligt, också fartyget.
Varje part som vidtar en sådan åtgärd skall informera den regeringsgemensamma organisationen för överläggningar om havet.
En part som behöver hjälp med att bekämpa förorening orsakad av olja eller andra skadliga ämnen som förorenar eller hotar att förorena dess kuster kan begära hjälp från andra parter, antingen direkt eller genom det regionala centrum som avses i artikel 6, med början hos de parter som kan förväntas bli påverkade av föroreningen.
Denna hjälp kan närmare bestämt bestå av expertråd och att produkter, utrustning och nautiska hjälpmedel levereras till eller ställs till förfogande för den berörda parten.
Parter som tillfrågas skall göra sitt bästa för att tillhandahålla assistans.
Om parter som deltar i en operation för att bekämpa förorening inte kan komma överens om hur operationen skall organiseras, kan det regionala centret, med parternas godkännande, samordna användningen av de resurser som dessa parter bidragit med.
Tillämpningen av de relevanta bestämmelser i artikel 6-10 i detta protokoll rörande det regionala centret skall där så är lämpligt utvidgas till att gälla även subregionala centra om sådana upprättas, varvid hänsyn tas till deras mål och funktioner samt deras samband med det regionala centret.
Ordinarie sammanträden mellan parterna i detta protokoll skall hållas i anslutning till ordinarie sammanträde mellan de avtalsslutande parterna i konventionen, som hålls i enlighet med konventionens artikel 14.
Parterna i detta protokoll kan också hålla extraordinarie sammanträden i enlighet med konventionens artikel 14.
Sammanträden mellan parterna i detta protokoll skall i synnerhet ha till syfte att a) fortlöpande granska genomförandet av detta protokoll, och att bedöma nyttan av de åtgärder som antagits samt behovet av andra åtgärder, i synnerhet i form av bilagor,
b) granska och vid behov foga bilagor till detta protokoll,
c) fullgöra sådana andra funktioner som är tillämpliga för genomförandet av detta protokoll.
Konventionens föreskrifter avseende protokoll skall tillämpas med avseende på detta protokoll.
De förfaranderegler och finansiella bestämmelser som fastslagits enligt konventionens artikel 18 skall til lämpas med avseende på detta protokoll om inte parterna i detta protokoll kommer överens om annat.

Inom handelns område är avtalets syfte att främja handeln mellan parterna, med beaktande av deras respektive utvecklingsnivå och av behovet att skapa bättre jämvikt i handeln, i syfte att öka tillväxttakten i Egyptens handel och förbättra villkoren för egyptiska varors avsättning på gemenskapsmarknaden.
A. Industrivaror
Med förbehåll för vad som föreskrivs i artiklarna 13, 14 och 16 skall tullar och avgifter med likvärdig verkan på import till gemenskapen av varor med ursprung i Egypten andra än de som är förtecknade i bilaga II till Fördraget om upprättandet av Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen eller i bilaga A avskaffas i enlighet med följande tidtabell: >Plats för tabell>
De tullar på vilka nedsättningarna enligt artikel 9 skall tillämpas skall vara - vad beträffar gemenskapen i dess ursprungliga sammansättning: de tullar som faktiskt tillämpades med avseende på Egypten den 1 januari 1975 i enlighet med bestämmelserna i bilaga 1 till avtalet av den 18 december 1972 mellan gemenskapen och Egypten, och
- vad beträffar Danmark, Irland och Förenade kungariket de tullar som faktiskt tillämpades med avseende på Egypten den 1 januari 1972.
De sålunda beräknade nedsatta tullsatserna skall avrundas till en decimal.
Dock skall artikel 9 tillämpas med avrundning till fyra decimaler vad gäller de särskilda tullar eller den särskilda del av blandade tullar som utgår enligt Irlands och Förenade kungarikets tulltaxor, förutsatt att gemenskapen tillämpar artikel 39.5 i akten om anslutningsvillkoren och anpassning av fördragen av den 22 januari 1972.
Vad beträffar tullar som har ett skyddselement och ett fiskalt element skall artikel 9 gälla för skyddselementet.
Förenade kungariket skall ersätta det fiskala elementet i de tullar som avses i punkt 1 med en nationell skatt i enlighet med artikel 38 i den akt om anslutningsvillkoren och anpassning av fördragen som avses i artikel 10.
verkan osm kvantitativa restriktioner på import till gemenskapen av varor med ursprung i Egypten andra än de som är förtecknade i bilaga II till Fördraget om upprättandet av Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen eller i bilaga B, skall avskaffas den dag detta avtal träder i kraft.
De åtgärder som föreskrivs i artikel 1 i protokoll 7 till den akt om anslutningsvillkoren och anpassning av fördragen som avses i artikel 10 avseende import av motorfordon och sammansättningsindustrin för motorfordon i Irland, skall tillämpas på Egypten.
För import av nedan angivna varor skall gälla årliga tak, vanför vilka de tullar som i övrigt faktiskt tillämpas på import från tredje land får återinföras i enlighet med punkt 26. Det tak som skall gälla det år då avtalet träder i kraft anges för varje varuslag.
>Plats för tabell>
Från och med året efter det att avtalet har trätt i kraft skall de tak som anges i punkt 1 årligen höjas med 5 %.
För varor hänförliga till Gemensamma tulltaxans nummer 28.40 B II (fosfater, inbegripet polyfosfater, andra än ammoniak) samt kapitel 76 (aluminium) i Gemensamma tulltaxan förbehåller sig gemenskapen rätt att införa tak.
När ett tak som har bestämts för införsel av en vara som omfattas av bestämmelserna i denna artikel har uppnåtts, får de tullar som faktiskt i övrigt tillämpas på import från tredje land återinföras att gälla import av varan till kalenderårets slut.
När importen till gemenskapen av en vara för vilken tak gäller har nått 75 % av den bestämda nivån, skall gemenskapen underrätta samarbetsrådet om detta.
De tak som föreskrivs i denna artikel skall upphävas senast den 31 december 1979.
Gemenskapen förbehåller sig rätten att modifiera de regler som gäller för petroleumprodukter enligt undernummer och nr 27.10, 27.11 A och B I, 27.12, 27.13 B och 27.14 i Gemensamma tulltaxan - då en gemensam ursprungsdefinition för petroleumvaror antas,
- då beslut fattas i enlighet med en gemensam handelspolitik, eller
- då en gemensam energipolitik fastställs.
I det fallet skall gemenskapen se till att import av dessa varor åtnjuter fördelar som är likvärdiga med dem som föreskrivs i detta avtal.
Beträffande tillämpningen av denna punkt skall på endera partens begäran samråd hållas inom samarbetsrådet.
Med förbehåll för vad som anges i punkt 1 skall detta avtal inte påverka de icke-tariffära regler som är tillämpliga på import av petroleumvaror.
För varor som framställts genom förädling av jordbruksprodukter förtecknade i bilaga C skall de tullnedsättningar som anges i artikel 9 tillämpas på den fasta delen av den avgift som tas ut vid import av dessa varor till gemenskapen.
B. Jordbruksprodukter
Tullsatsen vid import till gemenskapen av följande produkter med ursprung i Egypten skall nedsättas med den andel som anges för varje varuslag.
>Plats för tabell>
Punkt 1 skall gälla för färska citroner enligt undernummer 08.02 ex C i Gemensamma tulltaxan under förutsättning att priset på gemenskapens inre marknad på citroner importerade från Egypten, efter förtullning och efter avdrag av importavgifter andra än tullar, inte är mindre än referenspriset plus vad som på referenspriset tillkommer av tull beräknad efter den tullsats som faktiskt tillämpas vid import från tredje land jämte ett fast belopp av 1,2 beräkningsenheter per 100 kg.
De importavgifter, andra än tullar, som avses i punkt 2 skall vara de som används vid beräkning av införselpriserna enligt förordning (EEG) nr 1035/72 om den gemensamma organisationen av marknaden för frukt och grönsaker.
Gemenskapen skall dock ha rätt att beräkna det belopp som skall dras av i fråga om importavgifter andra än tullar enligt punkt 2 på sådant sätt, alltefter varans ursprung, att man undviker de svårigheter som kan uppkomma genom dessa avgifters inverkan på införselpriserna.
Artikel 23-28 i förordning (EEG) nr 1035/72 skall alltjämt gälla.
Trots vad som sägs i punkt 1 skall Danmark, Irland och Förenade kungariket ha rätt att fram till den 1 januari 1978 på import av färska apelsiner enligt undernummer 08.02 ex A i Gemensamma tulltaxan och färska mandariner (inbegripet tangeriner och satsumas), klementiner, wilkings och liknande citrushybrider enligt undernummer 08.02 ex B i Gemensamma tulltaxan tillämpa tullsatser som inte får vara lägre än vad som anges i bilaga D.
Tullen på import till gemenskapen av varor som har sitt ursprung i Egypten och som ingår i nedanstående förteckning skall utgå med följande tullsats: >Plats för tabell>
Gemenskapen skall vidta alla nödvändiga åtgärder för att se till att den avgift på import till gemenskapen av ris enligt undernummer 10.06 i Gemensamma tulltaxan och har sitt ursprung i Egypten är den som beräknas i enlighet med artikel II i förordning (EEG) nr 1418/76 om den gemensamma organisationen av marknaden för ris, minus ett belopp beräknat enligt punkt 3.
Föreskrifterna i punkt 1 skall gälla för en årlig kvantitet om högst 32 000 ton, förutsatt att Egypten tar ut en specialavgift på exporten av de varor som avses i den punkten och att denna specialavgift, som är lika stor som det belopp varmed importavgiften nedsatts, avspeglas i importpriset till gemenskapen.
Nedsättningen av importavgiften skall varje kvartal bestämmas av gemenskapen.
Den skall vara 25 % av genomsnittsnivån av importavgifterna under en referensperiod.
Denna referensperiod och tillämpningsföreskrifter för denna artikel skall bestämmas genom skriftväxling mellan parterna.
Samråd om hur reglerna i denna artikel fungerar skall äga rum inom ramen för samarbetsrådet.
Gemenskapen skall vidta alla nödvändiga åtgärder för att avgiften vid import till gemenskapen av kli och övrigt avfall från siktning, malning eller annan bearbetning av spannmål annan än majs och ris, hänförlig till 23.02 A II i Gemensamma tulltaxan och med ursprung i Egypten, blir den som beräknas enligt artikel 2 i förordning (EEG) nr 2744/75 om import- och exportsystemet för produkter framställda av spannmål eller av ris, minus ett fast belopp som svarar mot 60 % av avgiftens rörliga del.
Föreskrifterna i punkt 1 gäller under förutsättning att Egypten tar ut en specialavgift på exporten av de varor som där avses som är lika stor som det belopp varmed importavgiften sätts ned och att denna specialavgift avspeglas i importpriset vid import till gemenskapen.
Närmare tillämpningsföreskrifter för denna artikel skall fastställas i en skriftväxling mellan gemenskapen och Egypten.
Samråd om hur den ordning som föreskrivs i denna artikel fungerar skall äga rum inom samarbetsrådet på endera partens begäran.
De nedsättningar som anges i artikel 17 skall tillämpas på de tullsatser som faktiskt tillämpas gentemot tredje land.
De tullsatser som uppkommer genom de nedsättningar som görs av Danmark, Irland och Förenade kungariket får dock inte i något fall bli lägre än dem som dessa länder tillämpar gentemot gemenskapen i dess ursprungliga sammansättning.
Trots vad som sägs i punkt 1 får Danmark, Irland och Förenade kungariket behålla sina tullsatser, om til lämpningen av punkt 1 skulle medföra att tullsatserna tillfälligt förskjuts i riktning bort från den slutgiltiga tullen, detta till dess att nivån för tullen har uppnåtts vid en senare anpassning, eller så får de tillämpa den nivå som följer av en senare anpassning så snart som tullen når eller passerar den nivån.
De nedsatta tullar som beräknas i enlighet med artikel 17 skall avrundas till en decimal.
Dock skall avrundning göras till fyra decimaler vad gäller de särskilda tullar eller den särskilda del av blandade tullar som utgår enligt Irlands och Förenade kungarikets tulltaxor, förutsatt att gemenskapen tillämpar artikel 39.5 i den akt om anslutningsvillkoren och anpassning av fördragen som avses i artikel 10.
Den avgift på vilken de nya medlemsstaterna skall tillämpa nedsättningen enligt artikel 19 skall vara den som faktiskt utgår vid import från tredje länder.
I de nya medlemsstaterna skall den rörliga delen av den avgift som avses i artikel 19 beräknas med hänsyn till de avgifter som faktiskt tillämpas gentemot tredje land.
Om särskilda regler skulle införas till följd av genomförandet av gemenskapens jordbrukspolitik, eller om befintliga regler av detta skäl skulle modifieras eller om bestämmelserna om genomförandet av jordbrukspolitiken skulle modifieras eller utvecklas, får gemenskapen ändra de regler som fastställs i detta avtal vad gäller de ifrågavarande varorna.
I sådana fall skall gemenskapen ta vederbörlig hänsyn till Egyptens intressen.
Om gemenskapen vid tillämpningen av punkt 1 ändrar de regler som har fastställts genom detta avtal för produkter som omfattas av bilaga II till Fördraget om upprättandet av Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen, skall den ge import av varor med ursprung i Egypten en fördel som är jämförbar med den som föreskrivs i detta avtal.
Tillämpningen av denna artikel kan bli föremål för samråd i samarbetsrådet.
C. Gemensamma bestämmelser
De varor med ursprung i Egypten som avses i detta avtal får när de importeras till gemenskapen inte åtnjuta en gynnsammare behandling än den som medlemsstaterna tillämpar sinsemellan.
Vid tillämpningen av punkt 1 skall hänsyn inte tas till de tullar och avgifter med likvärdig verkan som följer av tillämpning av artiklarna 32, 36 och 59 i den akt om anslutningsvillkoren och anpassning av fördragen som avses i artikel 10.
Med förbehåll för de särskilda bestämmelser som gäller gränshandel skall Egypten medge gemenskapen en behandling på handelns område som inte är mindre gynnsam än den som ges mest gynnad nation.
Punkt 1 skall inte tillämpas vid bibehållandet eller inrättandet av tullunioner eller frihandelsområden.
Egypten får dessutom göra undantag från bestämmelserna i punkt 1 vad gäller åtgärder som vidtas i syfte att åstadkomma regional ekonomisk integration eller åtgärder som gynnar utvecklingsländerna.
Gemenskapen skall underrättas om sådana åtgärder.
Parterna skall vid undertecknandet av detta avtal underrätta varandra om de föreskrifter de tillämpar enligt gällande handelsavtal.
Egypten skall ha rätt att i sina regler för handel med gemenskapen införa nya tullar eller avgifter med motsvarande verkan och nya kvantitativa restriktioner eller åtgärder med likvärdig verkan och att höja de tullsatser och skärpa de kvantitativa restriktioner eller åtgärder med motsvarande verkan som tillämpas på varor med ursprung i eller som exporteras till gemenskapen, i de fall sådana åtgärder är nödvändiga på grund av Egyptens behov av industrialisering och utveckling.
Beträffande tillämpningen av sådana åtgärder skall samråd ske inom samarbetsrådet på endera partens begäran.
När Egypten tillämpar kvantitativa restriktioner i form av kvoter eller valutatilldelning för en viss vara i enlighet med sin lagstiftning skall den behandla gemenskapen som en enhet.
Vid de översyner av avtalet som föreskrivs i artikel 46 i avtalet skall parterna eftersträva att göra framsteg i an strängningarna att undanröja handelshinder samtidigt som man beaktar Egyptens väsentliga utvecklingsbehov.
Vid tillämpning av denna avdelning skall protokoll 2 som är fogat till detta avtal bestämma ursprungsreglerna.
Vid sådana modifikationer av nomenklaturen i parternas tulltaxor som påverkar de varor som avses i detta avtal får samarbetsrådet anpassa tullnomenklaturen för dessa varor så att de överensstämmer med modifikationerna, förutsatt att de verkliga fördelar som följer av detta avtal bibehålls.
Parterna skall avhålla sig från varje åtgärd eller bruk av intern fiskal karaktär som direkt eller indirekt innebär diskriminering mellan varor från den ena parten och likadana produkter med ursprung i den andra partens territorium.
Produkter som exporteras till någondera partens territorium får inte ge rätt till återbäring av nationell skatt utöver det belopp av direkt eller indirekt skatt som har påförts dem.
Betalningar som avser kommersiella transaktioner som utförs i enlighet med utländska handels- och valutabestämmelser och överföring av sådana betalningar till den medlemsstat i gemenskapen där betalningsmottagaren är bosatt eller till Egypten skall vara fria från varje restriktion.
Detta avtal skall inte hindra sådana förbud eller restriktioner för import, export eller transitering av varor som grundas på hänsyn till allmän moral, allmän ordning och allmän säkerhet eller intresset att skydda människors och djurs hälsa och liv, att bevara växter, att skydda nationella skatter av konstnärligt, historiskt eller arkeologiskt värde eller att skydda industriell och kommersiell äganderätt, eller regler avseende guld och silver.
Sådana förbud eller restriktioner får dock inte utgöra ett medel för godtycklig diskriminering eller innefatta en förtäckt begränsning av handeln mellan parterna.
Om någon av parterna finner att dumpning förekommer i handeln med den andra parten, får den vidta lämpliga åtgärder mot detta bruk i enlighet med överenskommelsen om tillämpning av artikel VI i GATT, på de villkor och i överensstämmelse med de förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 35.
Vad gäller åtgärder som riktas mot bonus eller subventioner åtar sig parterna att iaktta de regler som anges i artikel VI i GATT.
Om allvarliga störningar uppstår i någon sektor av näringslivet eller om svårigheter uppkommer som kan vålla en allvarlig försämring i en regions ekonomi, får den berörda parten vidta nödvändiga skyddsåtgärder på de villkor och i överensstämmelse med de förfaranden som fastställs i artikel 35.
I det fall en part underkastar varor som kan vålla svårigheter av det slag som avses i artikel 34 ett administrativt förfarande med syfte att snabbt iklarlägga tendensen i handelsflödena, skall den underrätta den andra parten om detta.
I de fall som anges i artiklarna 33 och 34 skall den berörda parten, innan han vidtar de åtgärder som där föreskrivits eller så snart som möjligt i de fall då punkt 3 b är tillämplig, lämna samarbetsrådet alla de relevanta uppgifter som behövs för en ingående undersökning av läget i syfte att finna en lösning som är godtagbar för parterna.
Vid valet av åtgärder skall företräde lämnas sådana som minst stör detta avtals funktion.
Åtgärderna får inte gå utöver vad som är strikt nödvändigt för att undanröja de svårigheter som har uppstått.
Samarbetsrådet skall omedelbart underrättas om alla skyddsåtgärder, och dessa skall behandlas vid regel bundna samråd inom samarbetsrådet, särskilt med avsikt att upphäva dem så snart som omständigheterna tillåter.
Vid tillämpning av punkt 2 skall följande gälla: a) Vad beträffar artiklarna 33 och 34 skall samråd i samarbetsrådet äga rum innan den berörda parten vidtar åtgärderna.
b) I undantagsfall som kräver omedelbar åtgärd och som gör en förhandsgranskning omöjlig, får den berörda parten i de situationer som anges i artiklarna 33 och 34 omedelbart tillämpa sådana försiktighetsåtgärder som är strikt nödvändiga för att undanröja svårigheterna.
När en eller flera medlemsstater i gemenskapen eller Egypten är i allvarliga svårigheter eller allvarligt hotas av svårigheter som rör dess betalningsbalans, får den berörda parten vidta nödvändiga skyddsåtgärder.
Vid val av åtgärder skall företräde lämnas sådana som minst stör detta avtals funktion.
Den andra parten skall omedelbart underrättas om alla skyddsåtgärder, och dessa skall behandlas vid regelbundna samråd inom samarbetsrådet, särskilt med avsikt att upphäva dem så snart som omständigheterna tillåter.
AVDELNING III ALLMÄNNA BESTÄMMELSER OCH SLUTBESTÄMMELSER

Vardera parten skall om andra parten så begär tillhandahålla alla relevanta uppgifter om alla avtal den sluter som innehåller regler om tull och handel och om alla ändringar i gällande tulltaxa och regler för utrikeshandel.
När sådana ändringar eller avtal har en direkt och särskild inverkan på detta avtals funktion, skall lämpligt samråd hållas inom samarbetsrådet på begäran av den andra parten så att avtalsparternas intressen kan beaktas.
Parterna skall vidta alla generella eller särskilda åtgärder som behövs för att fullgöra sina åtaganden enligt detta avtal.

Den skall dessförinnan lämna samarbetsrådet alla relevanta uppgifter som behövs för en ingående undersökning av läget i syfte att finna en lösning som är godtagbar för avtalsparterna.
Samarbetsrådet skall omedelbart underrättas om alla skyddsåtgärder, och dessa skall behandlas vid samråd inom samarbetsrådet, om den andra parten så begär.
Ingenting i detta avtal skall hindra endera parten från att vidta åtgärder a) som den finner nödvändiga för att hindra att uppgifter röjs som strider mot partens väsentliga säkerhetsintresse,
b) som avser handel med vapen, ammunition eller som avser krigsmateriel eller sådan forskning, utveckling eller produktion som är nödvändig för försvarsändamål, förutsatt att åtgärderna inte försämrar konkurrensvillkoren för varor som inte är avsedda för specifikt militära ändamål, eller
c) som den anser väsentliga för sin säkerhet i krigstid eller i ett tillstånd av allvarlig internationelt spänning.
På de områden som omfattas av detta avtal får - de regler som tillämpas av Egypten gentemot gemenskapen inte leda till diskriminering av medlemsstaterna, deras medborgare eller deras företag,

Herr...,
Jag har äran att bekräfta att jag har mottagit Ert brev av dagens datum med följande lydelse:
"Jag har äran att meddela Er att de nödvändiga villkoren har uppfyllts för tillämpningen, under förutsättning att referenspriset följs, av den koncession som föreskrivs i artikel 21.2 i samarbetsavtalet som undertecknades den 27 april 1976 mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Marocko och i artikel 14.2 i interimsavtalet för import till gemenskapen av vin med en av de ursprungsbeteckningar enligt marockansk lagstiftning som anges i nedanstående förteckning och för vilka Ni har begärt att ovannämnda bestämmelser skall tillämpas, nämligen: - BERKANE,

Jag bekräftar härmed att min regering är införstådd med innehållet i detta brev.
På Konungariket Marockos regerings vägnar
AVTAL mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen (EEG), och Belgien, Danmark, Frankrike, Förbundsrepubliken Tyskland, Förenade kungariket Storbritannien och Nordirland, Irland, Italien, Luxemburg och Nederländerna, som är medlemsstater i denna gemenskap (medlemsstaterna) å ena sidan, och Internationella utvecklingsfonden (Utvecklingsfonden) å andra sidan
DE AVTALSSLUTANDE PARTERNA HAR med beaktande av följande: a) EEG har beslutat att bidra till det särskilda åtgärdsprogram som beslöts vid konferensen om internationellt ekonomiskt samarbete för att täcka omedelbara behov i låginkomstländer vars allmänna problem med överföring av resurser hindrar deras utveckling.
b) För att genomföra detta beslut har EEG vänt sig till Utvecklingsfonden för att den på gemenskapens vägnar skall förvalta ett särskilt konto (det särskilda åtgärdskontot) med ett sammanlagt belopp motsvarande 385 miljoner USD, som skall bokföras separat och oberoende av alla andra av Utvecklingsfondens konton och tillgångar. Det skall användas för beviljande av krediter (särskilda åtgärdskrediter) med belopp som är tilläggsbelopp, både vad gäller lån till program och projekt, till Utvecklingsfondens planerade program under den tid för vilken det särskilda åtgärdskontot gäller för varje land som kan beviljas dessa belopp, och i övriga fall med ledning av det som anges nedan.
c) Det är EEG:s och medlemsstaternas målsättning, och Utvecklingsfonden skall sträva att säkerställa detta, att göra ett åtagande för hela det belopp som medlemsstaterna bidrar med inom sex månader från den dag då avtalet träder i kraft, och att beloppet så långt som möjligt utbetalas i form av krediter inom två år från den dagen.
d) EEG och Utvecklingsfonden har fört förhandlingar beträffande det föreslagna genomförandet och förvaltningen av detta avtal och förpliktelsen av medlen för att säkerställa en bred och geografiskt avvägd fördelning av dessa medel.
I detta syfte har Utvecklingsfonden tillhandahållit EEG en tabell som visar hur den föreslår att tillämpa de kriterier som fastställs i detta avtal.
INGÅTT FÖLJANDE AVTAL:
AVSNITT 1 Upprättande och förvaltning av det särskilda åtgärdskontot
Artikel 1
Utvecklingsfonden upprättar ett särskilt konto kallat "särskilda åtgärdskontot" som består av de belopp med vilka medlemsstaterna skall bidra till det särskilda åtgärdskontot i enlighet med bestämmelserna i detta avtal och vilket skall förvaltas och användas av Utvecklingsfonden, som kommer att agera som förvaltare (när Utvecklingsfonden handlar i denna egenskapen kallas den nedan "förvaltaren") endast för detta avtals ändamål och i enlighet med bestämmelserna i det.
Det särskilda åtgärdskontot skall bokföras separat och oberoende av alla andra av Utvecklingsfondens konton och tillgångar.
Artikel 2
Varje medlemsstat skall bidra till det särskilda åtgärdskontot med ett belopp i egen valuta som på dagen för detta avtals undertecknande motsvarar de belopp i USD som anges nedan för varje stat. >Plats för tabell>
Artikel 3
Inbetalningar av varje bidrag skall ske på följande sätt: a) Betalningar skall göras i medlemsstaternas valuta, antingen kontant eller i form av icke-räntebärande reverser från den medlemsstaten, vilka är betalbara vid anfordran och utställda på Utvecklingsfonden som förvaltare av det särskilda åtgärdskontot, samt deponerade hos Utvecklingsfondens depositarie i landet i fråga.
b) Inbetalningarna skall göras i två omgångar: i) Den första som består av minst 45 % av bidraget skall göras inom 30 dagar efter detta avtals ikraftträdande eller vid en annan tidpunkt som avtalas mellan EEG och förvaltaren.
ii) Den andra som utgör resten av bidraget skall göras senast den 1 januari 1979 eller vid en annan tidpunkt som avtalas mellan EEG och förvaltaren med hänsyn till den tid som är nödvändig för att parlamenten skall godkänna den årliga budgeten.
c) Varje medlemsstat som så önskar kan göra sina inbetalningar fortare än enligt ovan.
Artikel 4
Förvaltaren skall göra avdrag från kontanterna eller reverserna ungefär proportionellt till Utvecklingsfondens gängse förfaranden för att täcka utbetalningarna av de särskilda åtgärdskrediterna och upprätthålla ett rimligt saldo för det särskilda åtgärdskontot.
AVSNITT 2 Användning av det särskilda åtgärdskontot
Alla belopp som krediteras det särskilda åtgärdskontot skall enligt EEG:s krav användas av förvaltaren endast för beviljande av särskilda åtgärdskrediter till Utvecklingsfondens låginkomstmedlemmar med omedelbara behov, särskilt de minst utvecklade(1) och hårdast drabbade(2) utvecklingsländerna, vars utsikter för utveckling har gravt minskats på grund av externa faktorer och som står inför allmänna problem i samband med överföring av resurser, och som till följd av detta kan få svårigheter med att betala sina skulder.
Vid beviljande av sådana krediter skall förvaltaren i enlighet med EEG:s villkor ta hänsyn till följande faktorer: i) Utvecklingslandets relativa fattigdom och dess tillväxtmöjligheter på lång sikt.
ii) Den utsträckning i vilken landet är beroende av officiellt utvecklingsbistånd för sina externa kapitalresurser.
iii) Den utsträckning i viljen internationella ekonomiska faktorer har bidragit till landets aktuella och förväntade ekonomiska problem.
iv) Utveckling och prognoser för landets exportinkomster.
v) Landets möjlighet att importera varor som är nödvändiga för dess utvecklingsprocess.
vi) Sammansättningen och tendensen i landets skuldåtaganden och dess möjligheter till ytterligare krediter på icke-förmånliga villkor, samt
vii) den utsträckning i vilken de berörda ländernas problem kan lösas med hjälp av bidrag från andra källor.
Varje särskild åtgärdskredit skall beviljas för finansiering av ett utvecklingsprogram eller projekt (inbegripet ett sektorsprojekt) som är lätt att identifiera och ger snabb utbetalning, och som vare sig det omfattas av Utvecklingsfondens eget lånprogram eller inte skall värderas, godkännas och förvaltas i enlighet med det förfarande och den praxis som tillämpas vid utvecklingskrediter ut Utvecklingsfondens egna resurser, med hänsyn till den princip som avses i punkt b i ingressen till detta avtal, dvs. att krediten är ett tillägg till andra belopp.
Resurserna på det särskilda åtgärdskontot får inte användas som ersättning för Världsbankens reguljära resurser eller för Utvecklingsfondens resurser som i form av lån eller kredit skall användas till ett program eller ett projekt som vid dagen för detta avtals ikraftträdande blivit godkänt av Världsbankens eller Utvecklingsfondens styrelse.
Med förbehåll för avsnitt 4 skall villkoren för återbetalning av varje särskild åtgärdskredit vara desamma som de villkor som allmänt tillämpas för de utvecklingskrediter som Utvecklingsfonden beviljar, det vill säga, den skall återbetalas under en period av 50 år, under vilka de första 10 åren är betalningsfria.
De särskilda åtgärdskrediterna skall inte vara räntebärande.
Särskilda åtgärdskrediter skall beviljas i en eller flera av medlemsstaternas valutor och skall återbetalas i dessa valutor.
Artikel 5
>DEN>4 %) och kan betalas i varje valuta som Utvecklingsfonden godtar, och som beräknas på kapitalbeloppet av den kredit som utnyttjats och som vid den tidpunkten skall återbetalas, för att kompensera Utvecklingsfonden för arbetet i samband med krediten.
Denna avgift betalas direkt till och tillfaller Utvecklingsfonden.
Artikel 6
Varje särskild åtgärdskredit skall bekräftas med ett särskilt kreditavtal mellan låntagarlandet och förvaltaren, i vilket resursernas ursprung särskilt anges.
Artikel 7
Behållningen av varje särskild åtgärdskredit får användas till utgifter i låntagarlandets valuta eller till varor som tillverkas i eller tjänster som tillhandahålls av i) varje medlemsstat, ii) utvecklingsländer som är medlemmar i Utvecklingsfonden och som har rätt till en särskild åtgärdskredit, vilket fastställs av förvaltaren vid kreditavtalets ingående.
Artikel 8
Återbetalningen av kapitalbeloppet av de särskilda åtgärdskrediterna skall ske till det särskilda åtgärdskontot, och det belopp i en medlemsstats valuta som på detta sätt återbetalas skall så snart detta är möjligt av förvaltaren sändas tillbaka till denna medlemsstat.
Utvecklingsfonden skall inte vara ansvarig för eventuella underlåtelser i återbetalningen av särskilda åtgärdskrediter.
AVSNITT 3 Rapporter, samråd
Tills alla krediter har beviljats skall förvaltaren hålla EEG underrättad om de projekt och program som är under utarbetande för att övervägas av styrelsen, och om de projekt och program som har godkänts av styrelsen.
Så länge de särskilda åtgärdskrediterna utbetalas skall förvaltaren varje kvartal underrätta EEG om de särskilda åtgärdskrediternas utveckling och om vilka utbetalningar som gjorts i samband med dessa.
Så snart det är möjligt efter varje budgetår hos Utvecklingsfonden skall förvaltaren överlämna till EEG en utförlig redogörelse för det särskilda åtgärdskontot, tillsammans med ett yttrande från Utvecklingsfondens egna externa revisorer över denna redogörelse.
När de särskilda åtgärdskrediterna till fullo har betalats ut skall förvaltaren så snart det är möjligt överlämna till EEG en utförlig rapport om de projekt och program som finansierats av det särskilda åtgärdskontot.
Förvaltaren skall utarbeta och upprätthålla lämpliga register och räkenskaper för att kunna identifiera de bidrag som görs till det särskilda åtgärdskontot, de förpliktelser som skall finansieras av detta konto, samt inkommande och utgående belopp på kontot och återbetalningar till medlemsstaterna.
EEG och förvaltaren skall ha ett nära samarbete för att uppnå målen med detta avtal.
I detta syfte skall EEG (som företräds av Kommissionen för de europeiska gemenskaperna) och förvaltaren med jämna mellanrum utväxla synpunkter på det särskilda åtgärdskontots status och utvecklingen för de program och projekt som bekostas av de särskilda åtgärdskrediterna, och alla andra ärenden i samband med detta avtal, tills det särskilda åtgärdskontot till fullo har betalats ut.
AVSNITT 4 Avtalets upphörande, fördelning
Om detta avtal inte trätt i kraft den 31 december 1978, eller vid en senare tidpunkt som avtalats mellan EEG och Utvecklingsfonden, skall detta avtal och alla förpliktelser för parterna som det innebär omgående upphöra.
Om och när hela kapitalbeloppet i alla särskilda åtgärdskrediter som låntagarna har utnyttjat återbetalats och återsänts till medlemsstaterna enligt artikel 2 avsnitt 8 i detta avtal skall detta avtal och alla förpliktelser för parterna som det innebär omgående upphöra.
AVSNITT 5 Slutbestämmelser
Detta avtal skall godkännas av varje medlemsstat och EEG enligt varje parts förfaranden.
Regeringen i varje medlemsstat skall till generalsekretariatet för Europeiska gemenskapernas råd anmäla när det förfarande som gäller för avtalet har avslutats.
Generalsekretariatet skall till Utvecklingsfonden vidarebefordra denna anmälan tillsammans med en anmälan om att EEG i god och behörig form godkänt detta avtal.
Detta avtal skall gälla och träda i kraft den första dagen i den månad som följer efter Utvecklingsfondens mottagande av sådana anmälningar.
Detta avtal upprättas i två exemplar på danska, engelska, franska, italienska, nederländska och tyska språken, vilka samtliga texter är lika giltiga.
AVTAL i form av skriftväxling om ändring av avtalet mellan Europeiska gemenskapen och Schweiz
Brev nr 1
Bryssel den.....
Hr. ambassadör,
Till följd av genomförandet från och med den 1 januari 1978 dels av Tullsamarbetsrådets rekommendation av den 18 juni 1976 om ändring av nomenklaturen för varors klassificering i tulltaxor och dels av vissa fristående ändringar i Gemensamma tulltaxan och i den schweiziska tulltaxan bör en motsvarande anpassning göras av nomenklaturen för vissa varubeskrivningar i avtalet mellan Europeiska ekonomiska gemenskapen och Schweiz, undertecknat den 22 juli 1972.
En artikel 12a bör dessutom införas i avtalet för att förenkla det förfarande som i framtiden skall följas vid en anpassning av varubeskrivningarna i händelse av nya ändringar i en avtalsslutande parts tulltaxa.
Ovan nämnda ändringar bifogas.
Jag har äran att bekräfta att gemenskapen samtycker till dessa ändringar och jag föreslår att de träder i kraft den 1 januari 1978.
Jag vore tacksam om Ni ville bekräfta att Er regering samtycker till ovanstående.
Högaktningsfullt,
På Europeiska gemenskapernas råds vägnar
